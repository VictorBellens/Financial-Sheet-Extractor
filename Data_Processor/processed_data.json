It would then have to proceed to the unelected\nSenate.\n\nImperial Tobacco Ltd, a unit of Imasoo Ltd <IMS.TO> controls about 65\npercent of the Canadian cigarette market.

Following my note of yesterday, Cliff Muller confirmed\norally that the formal assignment deeds may run A to 8 now; B to C later, which\nwill simplify the documentation preparation and add consistency to the overall\ntransaction. I await his written confirmation\n\nRegarding Point 3: At the 28 gun 00 meeting, I thought the preferred name was\nPhilip Morris Products Inc, with Philip Morris Products SA as a backup.\n\nRegarding Point 4: I recall the consensus determined that the name change would\noccur after the effective date of the transaction. This is important, because\nif I prepare the documents to effect transfer to PTR, and if a name change\noccurs before, FIR will have to record the name change in a separate transaction\nbefore the assignments can be recorded, and then I will have to redo all the\ndocuments to reflect the new name. Tmportantly, the decision on when the name\nchange occurs must be made now\n\nRegarding Point 6: I would like copies of the Primary Trademark Transfer\nAgreement; Diversification Trademarks Transfer Agreement; and Service agreement\nfor Patent and Trademark Administration and Support for comment.\n\nSince more than a month has elapsed since the last meeting, I believe a meeting\nor conference call is essential to coordinate and confirm status of the various\nefforts.\n\nOriginal Message:\n\n2078454137",

Excluding one-time items at Nabisco in 1998 and up-front\ntobacco litigation settlement charges in 1997, net income per diluted common share was\n$.47 in the 1998 third quarter, down 37 percent from $.75 per diluted common share\nrecorded in last year's third quarter. On the same basis, 1998 third quarter net income was\n$164 million, a 36 percent decrease from net income of $255 million in the 1997 third\nquarter.\n\n\u201cOur international tobacco business was severely affected by deteriorating economies in\nRussia and other markets in the Commonwealth of Independent States,\u201d said Steven F.\nGoldstone, RJR Nabisco\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer, \u201cUpheavals in the CIS,\nalong with adverse effects from foreign currency translation, were the primary reasons\nbehind the substantial profit decline at Reynolds International. Those problems caused, in\ntur, an increase in RIR Nabisco\u2019s corporate tax rate for the remainder of the year, which\nadded to our profit decline.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurrently, conditions remain crratic in Russia and the surrounding regions. While we are\nunhappy with the performance of Reynolds International, we recognize the risks inherent\nin emerging, volatile markets,\u201d Goldstone said. \u201cLonger term, our investments in the\nregion should enable us to build a large business in a market that, while still evolving,\npromises to be very attractive. Conditions in these markets won't recover overnight, but\nwe belive that, over time, we will regain attractive profit and volume growth rates.\n\nThe company said that by the end of the quarter, volume had improved in Russia and the\nCIS although, short term, profits are expected to continue 1 be severely hurt as\nconsumers trade down to lower-margin brands during this volatile period.\n\nRJR0000000002000224\n\n70044 3221\n\ntze2 egees",

There was 1\nsample taken from this machine, (Results were 11,93) This is .18 above target, I spoke\nwith Jerry Manuel about how this blend was put up and after looking at the information,\n\u2018we concluded it was put up appr<<File Attachment: MA16327.XLS>>ximately +20\nheavy. Looking at the one result we received, it tracks this thought. I can't explain the\nnumbers seen on the Phase II, but we are tracking OK using Cate/Fate.\n\nRJR0000000421085988,\n\n70032 5897\n\n4862 oBzzs",

They can give out waming citations and track violators on a juvenile record card. Police also\n\n\u2018can compel repeat offenders to attend lectures on the health effects of tobacco use, go to an intensive stop-smoking\n\"ogram, oF face a juvenile complaint in Municipal Court.\n\nCity officials have reacted to a nationwide survey of high school students that revealed one of every three students\n\u2018smokes despite federally mandated labels on cigarette packages that wam of potentially severe health effects. In\nBroward County, Fla., for instance, youths caught smoking are hauled into Teen Smoking Court for a voicebox lecture by\n\u2018a former smoker who lost his vocal cords to cancer.\n\nvery glad it was passed. Im sure it will help some youngsters,\" said Mayor John Murrin, who had pressed the council\nto enact a smoking ban,\n\n\u201cThe key thing is that it is educational, not punitive in nature,\u201d said Murrin, an elementary school teache\n\u2018sending copies of that ordinance to the school system to disseminate in their newsletters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIwill be\n\n\u2018Murrin\u2019s stand on banning smoking was supported by a petition signed by more then 200 Lekeside Middle Schoo!\nstudents. He also cited similar ordinances enacted in Ridgewood, Flemington, and other New Jersey communities.\n\n\u2018Only one resident spoke against the ordinance at Wednesday's public hearing. After it was in roduced fast month, t was\n\u2018opposed by Regina Carlson, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the Group Against Smoking Pollution\n(GASP), which is based in Summit,\n\nCarlson cfiticized the ordinance as \"making outcasts of the kids we should be helping. There are other things towns can\ndo that are far more effective,\" she said,\n\nCarson recommended banning cigarette vending machines, cracking down on merchants who sell cigarettes to minors,\n\u2018and enacting laws that banned adults as well as minors from smoking in public places,\n\n\u2018Murtin said this week that he welcomed Carlson's suggestions, but that he fell banning smoking by minors also makes\nose.\n\n\"Anything we can do to help educate youngsters is fine,\" he said. \"You want fo use as many varied approaches as\npossible to help solve this problem.\u201d\n\n71716-0144",

Long delays for clearing the merchandize through the St.\nPetersburg port.\n\n\u2018+ With today\u2019s logistics situation in St. Petersburg a load, in the worst case scenario, takes 28 days for\nclearance. Therefore, we would need at least 20 days free demurrage in our negotiations.\n\n+ Alexander is asking us to not use the folowing shipping lines :\nContainerships, Hanjin, Cho Yang, Evergreen, Hapag Lloyd and P&O Nedlloyd as they use the Timber port\n\u2018which is the worst in St. Petersburg. This is to reduce our costs.\n\n\u2018+ We are currently using one agent in St, Petersburg which helps us with all he shipping lines.\n\n\u2018For the clearance of the goods arriving by truck or ral, almost the same procedures apply. The differance is\n\u2018that goods are unloaded in the bonded warehouse thus eliminating truck demurrage charges.\n\nRJRO000001129048366\n70057 2749\n\nLieb zgtes",

As you stated correctly, to date we have only determined\nparticle size distributions in diluted smoke. The data obtained for dilutad smoke do not necessarily have to be\nindicative tor undiluted smoke. One reason may be that at the smoke age at which we are analyzing diluted smoke is\nalready in a kind of steady-state, which is determined by physico-chemical parameters rather than by the original size\ndistribution.\n\nWe do not have a method at hand to determine particle size distribution in undiluted smoke, and we are unsure\nwhether we will ever have one. This is due to the fact that our measuring devices are unable to deal withthe high\n\u2018smoke concentrations of undiluted smoke. We are expecting severe artifacts the less diluted the smoke sample will\nbe. We will ry to use decreasing dilution factors starting from the condition of an inhalation study and see whether we\nCan extrapolate to no dilution. Because of the expected artifacts, we wil try to determine the particle size distribution\nwith different experimental approaches.\n\n\u2018Based on the above reasoning, we cannot include this end point in the request for the extreme puffing study to be\n\u2018executed during the rest of the year. Also, we will not be able to work full speed on the above-suggesied approach\n\u2018due to limitations with other (WSA) projects.\n\nBest regards, 2067227273",

        "RJRO00000\u00b0\n70013 2883\n\nCorporate Responsibility: Marketing\n\nR.J. Reynolds Tobacoo Company believes that cigarette smokingers are at significantly increasesd\n\u2018mokers: risks for a number of diseases and conditions, including lung cancer, cardiovascular\ndisease (including heart disease) and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (emphysema and\nchronic bronchitis). Our company\u2019s philosophy is to operate as if smoking is a cause of these\ndiseases. AS a result, we believe that children should not smoke.-We-believe-thatanyene-wheie-\nalready. at ick for-any-of the diseases that have been assosiated with smoking should-net smoke.\nWe believe that pregnant women should not smoke. We believe that children should not be exposed\nto secondhand cigarette smoke or any other aitbome irritant. Reynolds Tobacco is not interested in\ntrying to persuade any nonsmokers to begin smoking or to persuade any smokers to-continiie-\nomeking-not to quit,\n\n\u2018These are among the reasons that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco supports minimumn-age laws that prohibit\n\u2018etalers from selling cigarettes to minors in al 50 states. And these are among the reasons that RJ.\nReynolds and other cigarette manufacturers signed a comprehensive master settlement agreement\n\u2018with the states in November 1998. Among many other things, that agreement formalizes what have\nJong been RJR's youth smoking policies and practices: prohibiting any advertising, promotion or\nmarketing directly or indirectly targeted to minors; and prohibiting any actions aimed at iniating,\nmaintaining or increasing youth smoking. In addition to the MSA, Reynolds Tobacco also abides by\na voluntary advertising and promotion code. (See below for more information about the voluntary\ncode.)\n\nSettlement,\n\nReynolds Tobacco is not interested in, and does nothing aimed at, trying to persuade any\nnonsmokers to begin smoking. We believe thal those adults who choose fo smoke should do so with\n\u2018an awareness of the risks that have been associated with smoking. And we believe that those\n\u2018smokers who want to quit certainly should, and should take advantage of whatever methods they\nbelieve will help.\n\n\u2018As a responsible marketer of a legal product with known and inherent health risks, R.J. Reynolds\nTobacco Company has for many years carefully evaluated products, processes and ingredients to\ncensure that they do not increase the inherent risks associated with cigarette smoking.\n\nReynolds Tobacco has also been at the forefront in developing and applying methods to assess the\nrelative toxicity of cigarette smoke. This work, along with our expertise in tobacco and smoke\n\u2018chemistry, has aided us in our long-standing and ongoing efforts to develop cigarettes that may have\nthe potential to reduce the risks associated with smoking. We have also pioneered a number of\n\u2018techniques to reduce overall \u201ctar\u201d and nicotine yields, and we have developed technologies to reduce\n\u2018specific compounds and classes of compounds in cigarette smoke,\n\nGlick here to go to Research Milestones\n\nPrior to the master settlement agreement, Reynolds Tobacco and the other major cigarette\n\u2018manufacturers adopted and operated under a voluntary cigarette advertising and promotion code.\nSimilar to the MSA, the code was designed to emphasize the companies\u2019 policies that smoking\n\u2018solely for adults. The code combined the provisions of the original cigarette advertising code of 1964,\n\u2018as restated in 1982; the code of cigarette sampling practices of 1981, as amended in 1983; and the\n\u2018additional restrictions on cigarette advertising and promotion adopted by the industry in 1990. Today,\nthe majority of the code's provisions have been included in or superceded by the master settlement\n\u2018agreement. There are several code rules, which go beyond the master settlement agreement,\nhowever, to which Reynolds Tobacco stil adheres.\n\n1233067450\n\ngszo 46L2\u00a2",

Philip Moris etal. case which\nattempted to recover certain health cate costs incurred in treating purported smoking-related illnesses.\n\u2018The appeals court ruled that the plaintiff's claim fails under Alabama law, which allows only the most\ndirectly injured party (the individual smokers themselves) to sue to recover money. \u2018The court reasoned\nthat the unions were too far removed from the injury to justify direct action (PR Newswire 8/28,\nBernstein Research Call 8/29).\n\n+ US. District Judge Charles Breyer on August 28% ordered Olympic Airways to pay $700,000\nto survivors of Abid M. Hanson, a California physician who reportedly dled after being seated close to\nsmoking section on Olympic\u2019s flight from Athens to San Francisco in January 1998.

The sum total of scientific evidence\nestablishes beyond reasonable doubt that cigarette smoking is a causative factor in the\nrapidly increasing incidence of human epidermoid carcinoma of the lung [emphasis\nadded.\u201d\n\n* \"The study group concludes that smoking of tobacco, particularly in the form of\ncigarettes, is an important health hazard.

This note is to discuss my recommendation\nregarding the proposal entiled, \"Quantitative Determination whether Cotinine is Present in Fruits and Vegetables,\u201d by Prot.\nWemer Pfannhauser recently submitted to the SRRC. To some extent its inappropriate for me to make a\nrecommendation, since | was the person that asked for this proposal to be submitted. However, I can take this opportunity\n10 explain why I wanted to have the work done.\n\n\u2018As you well know for many years the argument has been advanced that some percentage of cotinine found in human body\n\n\u2018fluids could have originated from dietary sources. This argument has frequently been regarded as being complete fantasy\nbby some individuals, and as having considerable support by others. When Don Leyden was asked to look into the issue\n\u2018about two years ago, it was his conclusion that the axisting data were so unreliable that no real conclusions could be\ndrawn. Therefore, he solicited a proposal from Dr. Plannfauser's laboratory to undertake a thorough study that would\nresult in meaningful data. That proposal was approved by the SRA, and the work has been completed. Dr. Pfannhauser\ndeveloped a new method for being able to both extract and measure the nicotine in a number of food substances.\n\u2018Accurate measurements were made of these levels, and based on food frequency data, estimates can now be made as to\nthe levels of nicotine-derived cotinine in body fluids that are to be of dietary origin. This work is now being documented in\nthree publications. The frst, a method development paper, has been accepted by the Journal of Chromatography and isin\npress. (The paper was accepted with no revisions, which Don tells me is quite unusual.) The second paper, which\ndescribes the results, is almost complete, and it wil be submitted to a food sciences journal. The third paper, which will\ndiscuss the relative proportion of cotinine in body fluids deriving from ETS and from the diet, s stil in preparation,\n\n{A the time that work was started, | suggested that we quantitate both nicotine and cotinine simultaneously. My reasons\nwere, that there is no reason to assume that just because nicotine is the final product in the alkaloid biosynthetic path in\ntobacco, that its also the final product in other plants. Most plants possess enzymes that could oxidize nicotine to\n\u2018cotinine, and cotinine is by far & more stable product. Also, as is pointed out in the proposal, for tomatoes, at least, the\n\u2018amount of nicotine decreases as tomatoes age, and the nicotine may have been converted to cotinine. Untortunetely it\n{turned out that it was not possible to develop a method which would extract, in a sulficiently pure state, both cotinine and\nricotine. Therafore, the cotinine work could not be done.\n\n~\n\n' feel strongly that unti! we can confirm that cotinine is or is not present in foodstuffs of the Solanaceae family, we will not\n\nhhave completed this project. Therefore, | would strongly urge that this proposal be funded by the SRRC. Based on the\n\n\u2018excellent results produced by Dr. Pfannhauser's laboratory regarding the nicotine study, there can be no doubt that they\n\n\u2018can do an excellent job on this project,\n\nTed",

        "Quote of the Week: \u201c1s a tantastic move and long overdve.\n\nWA 99-49\nDecember 2, 1999\n\nChairman of Action on Smoking and\n\nHealth Simon Chapman, lauding the Queensland government's plan to take legal action.\n\nASIA AND OCEANIA\n\nAustralia: Queensland Investigates Legal\nAction Against Tobacco Companies\n\u2018The Queensland government is exploring legal action\n\u2018against tobacco companies in an attempt (o retrieve\ncosts allegedly incuted treating smoking-related\nillnesses. On November 29\u00b0, the State cabinet will\ndiscuss a proposal which outlines options on how to\nrecover the money. If tho eabinot decides to take the\ncase to court, analysts believe it might lead to a wave\nof litigation by other State governments against\ntobaceo companies, mirroring similar action in the\nUS in which 46 states setled for US$ 206 billion in\ncompensation over the next 25 years,\n\nQueensland's Premier Peter Beaitic alleged\nthat almost 30,000 Queensland residents are admitted\nto hospitals annually due to ilinesses caused by\nsmoking, and treatment of those illnesses costs\nQueensland an estimated $110 million (USS 70 mn) a\nyear. He added that if Queensland is successful in its\niegal action, he plans to put any compensation\nreceived back into its health system, He conceded,\nhowever, that given the large contributions tobacco\ncompanies make to the public fund through federal\nexcise duties cach year, it will be difficult to win\n\u201ccompensation.\u201d According to Philip Morris, over\nAS 500 million (USS 317.6 mn) is paid annually to\nQueensland in tobacco taxes.\n\nState Cancer Rate Scrutinized: Queensland\nreported the highest incidences of various types of\n\u2018cancer, including \u2018smoking related\u2019 cancer in\nAustralia, Graeme Brien, executive director for\n\u2018Queensland Cancer Fund, believes there were several\nfactors that contributed to the state\u2019s high cancer rate,\nsuch as the state's resistance to anti-smoking\ncampaigns 10-20 years ago and availability of the\ncountry's cheapest cigarettes. Cigarettes were not\nsubject to license fees in Queensland until the late\n\nRJR0000001531021996\n70097 2157\n\n1980's, and the state did not adopt cigarette\nadvertisement bans atthe same rate as other states,\n\nASH Lauds Queensland: Action on\nSmoking and Health (ASH) chairman Simon\nChapman believes Queensland has an \u201cexcellent\nchance in winning because... tobacco company\ndocuments in the United States have shown that\nsmoking and nicotine fare] harmful to your health,\u201d\nHe belioves other Australian States are considering\nlegal action against tobacco companies, but doubted\nthatthe Federal government would become involved,\n\nNo Immediate Plans for NSW: On\n\u2018November 29\", the New South Wales (NSW)\ngovernment stated that it has not made any decisions.\n\u2018on whether to follow Queensland in suing tobacco\n\u2018companies. According to NSW Attorney General\nJeff Shaw, a committee has been organized to\ninvestigate the possibility of reclaiming health care\n\u2018costs but iis sil in its early stages. Cancer Counc\nchief executive Andrew Penman feels that a State suit\n\u2018against (obacco companies for high health costs\nstands 10 reason, given that \u201c[S}moking in NSW costs\nthe state an estimated A$ 4.2 billion (US$ 2,66 bn)\nevery year and occupies nearly 250,000 bed days\nannually\u201d (AAP Information Services 11/28, Austral-\nAsian Business Intelligence 11/30, AAP Information\nServices 11/29, Courier Mail 11/29).\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\nlemative\u201d Tobaceo Uses .\n\n2.

They are buying cigarettes in the usual\npopular brands (esp. PM brands) from VA and NC wholesalers and then bringing\nthem to FL by the truck load. These are all of our gray marketers accompanied\nby their lawyer (that paragon of legal ethics, Barry Boren) finding a new\ncottage industry to circumvent normal distribution chains! The cigarettes are\nsupposedly a lot cheaper to buy up there. When they are bringing them to FL,\nthey are supposedly putting FIL. tax stamps on them (allegedly ~ of course DBPR\nalso seized a counterfeit tax stamp machine last week... ). Is this legal\n\nunder the Jenkins Act? 1am familiar with the name of the act and know it\nconcerns interstate trafficking in cigarettes, but I know nothing else about\n\nthat law. IF they pay the FL tax, is this legal? Our agent advises me that this\n\nis not a violation of FL law (-- although I doubr they have checked with agency\ncounsel to confirm this) Lam sure FL wholesalers would havea litter of\n\nkittens over this practice, the question is, is it legal? (or do we just need\n\nto make it that way). It seems to set up the potential for blackmarket trade if\nthey have the capacity for stamping (especially counterfeit stamping). Have\nyou heard of this practice occuring in other states? Please let me know your\n\u2018thoughts on this and ifit isa legal problem, we will of course do anything and\neverything we can to work with you to deal with this, Thanks!

The most economical way for us to know where the tobacco is going to be is designation,\u201d Duncan\nsaid.\n\nA 14-member statutory committee created in 1985 which has recommended the grading fee and level of service\n{n the past decided to keep the fee the same as last year at $1 per 100 pounds, but declined to recommend a level\nof service, Duncan said.\n\n\u201cThey left it up to the tobacco program to wait until we have a better idea of where the tobacco will be,\u201d Dunean\nsaid.\n\nBefore direct purchase contracting, USDA determined sets of graders by the history of each market, but the\narrival of contracting and its expected increase has made it all but impossible to calculate need.\n\nPhilip Morris U.S.A. opened a receiving station in Maysville last year. At the end of the 2000 sale season\nBrown and Williamson announced its intention to operate a station in Maysville and RJ Reynolds signed on in\nMorehead.\n\n\u201cSeis of graders will be decreased quite a bit more. We had 31 sets last year (down from 51 in 1998) and ifthe\nindications of the amount of tobacco we're hearing will be contracted, it will probably be half (of 31) next year,\u201d\n\u2018Duncan said.",

Additonal, he indicated tat we had made a very strong case that he\nWould consider and asked us fo stay in touch about our progress.\n\n\u2018Senator Judd Gregg: The meeting with Senator Gregg was very postive. While not completely endorsing our postion, he\noffered to discuss the mater with Senator Frist. His staff indicated that whl this matter had not been on the Commitoo's\n{nial priorty schedule, there had been some indication that Chairman Jeffords may now be more wiling to\n\nsometime this year.

Senator Gregg also indicated that McCain\n\u2018may try to usurp the jusdicon of the HELP Commitee on this issue.\n\n\u2018Mitch Bainwot: We discussed the potcs ofthis issue with Bainwel and presentod come poslve data developed by Linda\nDiVal.

Rush\nDate: May 31, 1999\n\nRe: Review of Bum Rate Reduction by Urea and DAP.\n\nReview of the literature has failed to produce any reference by Philip Morris to the effect of the\naddition of urea on the burn rate of tobacco or tobacco related materials. However, research by\n\u2018Brown & Williamson indicated that the addition of up to 5% urea to the total blend could increase\nthe puff count by about 10 to 15%\u201d, Later research showed that the addition of 4% urea to the\nflue-cured portion of a reduced-tar blend (9 mg.) increased the puff count from 8 to 10, No\nreference to the urea treatment of reconstituted tobacco or stems or other tobacco blend\n\u2018component has been identified,\n\n\u2018A snudy conducted by Lorillard involved both DAP and Urea. The purpose of the study was to\ndetermine the effects on smoke data ofthe addition of ammonia releasing compounds, including\n\nurea and DAP, The data showed a statistical difference between the control (no additive) and the\naddition of either compound. The increases in puff count for filtered cigarettes were found to be\n\n6.14% and 7.9% for 1% and 2% urea respectively, and 6.2%, 6.8% and 10.7% for 1%, 2% and 3%\nDAP respectively\u201c,\n\nSeveral references by Brown and Williamson were found that related the burn rate reduction of\nammonium phosphate. An early attempt to add 16% by weight of 85% phosphoric acid to a\ntobacco blend before expansion by the DIET process to \u201cfix\u201d the nicotine and adding 12.5% of\n30% aqueous ammonia after expansion was found to produce a tobacco that would not support\ncombustion. Inclusion of the treated expanded tobacco into a VUL 100 blend at a 50% level\nproduced cigarettes that extinguished between puffs. However, inclusion at the 5 10 10% level\ncould add a puff to the cigarette instead of a 0.4 puff reduction as isthe norm for 10% expanded\ntobacco inclusion \u00ae, Later, in an attempt to alter burley stems so they would smoke like fue-\n\u2018cured stems, a cigarette blend that included 17% stems containing 5% DAP produced 0.5\npufis/cigarette more than a similar blend with untreated stems\u201d,\n\n1, Alkaline Tobacco Smoke, Part 2: Effet of Urea on Smoke Chemisty, R.

They find, among other things that 30 percent of all eancer deaths are duc\nto smoking, another 30 percent from bed dict. Two alcoholic drinks a day, they say, can increase breast\n\u2018cancer rales by 25 percent, and both men and women who are 35 pereent above ther ideal weight have a\n\u2018much greater chance of developing cancer.\n\nWell they're sobering statistics. Our modical editor Tim Johnson is standing by in Boston to diseuss them\nwith us\n\n\u2018Tim it sounds a file bit ike follow the rules and you don't get cancer.\n\nDr, TIMOTHY JOHNSON reporting:\n\n\u2018Well, not so. Even if this estimate is correct that leaves $0 pereent that aren't preventable either from\nexternal faciors like environment, or internal factors like genetics, but it docs remind us that 50 percent is\n\n\u2018a huge dent if we change personal practices in terms of personal prevention.\n\nJENNINGS: And those of us who are over 50, he said delicately, When do we have to sart oF i 100\nfate?\n\nJOHNSON: The obvious answer is the earlier the etter, but the other important answer is tha it pays to\nuit these bad practices at anytime. For example, with smoking: If you stop smoking within five years,\n\u2018You've reduced your risk for lung cancer to half that ofa smoker. Within 10 t0 20 years, is thal of a non-\nSmoker, $0 it pays t0 quit at any time\n\nIBNNINGS: So, ina phrase, coming from Harvard today, this is 8 good guideline for life,\n\nJOHNSON: Very good guideline for life, and i reminds us that we have contol over maybe 50 porcent of\ncancer deaths.

Results of this study, together with earlier studies that employed other\nsmoking regimens, confirm that \u201cbenchmarking\u201d is a practical means of providing smoke\nconstituent yield data for cigarette brands sold in Massachusetts. An innovative \u201csingle testing\nlaboratory\u2019 approach to analytical measurement was developed by the participating laboratories\nto address a current lack of standardized, interlaboratory validated analytical methods for\nmeasuring smoke constituent yields with the Massachusetts smoking regimen. During the\ncourse of the study, more than 20,000 individual measurements were conducted on a cohort of\ncigarette brand styles representing cigarettes sold in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and\nmore broadly throughout the United States. The massive amount of data produced from the\nstudy, generated by four participating laboratories, provides a means of evaluating the\nfunctional relationships between individual smoke constituent yields (specified by the\nCommonwealth in the proposed regulation) and fundamental cigarette smoke yield prediction\nParameters such as nicotine, \u201ctar\u201d and carbon monoxide. This paper will briefly review the\nbenchmark concept and the study design. It will also provide a general overview of the study\nresults.\n\nRJR0000001177019512\n70026 1948\n\n9908 lz6zs",

The current charity-care program, financed through\nthe unemployment insurance fund, expires Dec. 31.\n\nBut Haylaian and Senate President Donald 7. DiFrancesco, R-Union, asked the administration to\ncalculate the cost of charity care and provide a revised cost estimate within wo weeks. The request came\nduring a Monday meeting between Governor Whitman and GOP leader, officials said Tuesdey.\n\n\u201cThere's always the hope we can do things fora litle less money,\u201d said Carl Golden, spokesman forthe\ngovernor. \"Weite trying to look for some savings in the system.\"\n\nBusiness leaders have objected to the continved use of unemployment insurance funds. Baler this\n\u2018month, Health Commissioner Len Fishman proposed a five-year plan that would increase the state's\ncigarette tax from 40 cents 1060 cents, impose a 1.5 percent tax on hospital revenes, and continue o divert\n$200 million out of the Unemployment Insurance Trust.\n\nDiFrancesco said Tuesday that GOP senators oppose a tax on hospital revenucs. Instead, he said, some\ngeneral revenues may be needed.\n\n\u2018The govemor is reluctant _but not firmly opposed _o tapping general revenues, Golden said. \"Any\nkind of additional expenditure would have tobe looked at very, very carefully inthe context of the overall\nbudget and whether it can afford it.\" he seid.\n\nRepublicans also may revise the formula used to distribute charty-care funds, DiFrancesco said. Key\nDemocratic senators on Monday threatened to withhold support for any charity-care plan unless the formula\nis changed to guarantee that hospitals treating the majority of uninsured patients receive the bulk of the\nfunding\n\n\"The formula is open for discussion,\u201d DiFrancesco said. \"If inequities exist, they ought to be\naddressed.\u201d\n\nBut if changes are made to aocommodate Democrats, DiFrancesco said, they should be willing to\nsupport possible tax inereases to finance the program. \"fit i an urban problem... hey should\nparticipate.\u201d he said,\n\nDemocratic Senate leaders were not available for comment.

Enforcement officials have mentioned problems caused by retailers\nwho \"flip\" licenses to a new corporation. It appears that this is a significant\nproblen which requires serious attention, While we are not familiar with the\nspecifics of the adminstration's plans in this area, we look forward to working\nwith state and city officials to share information about how other states and\ncities are addressing this issue and enacting an ordinance to solve this\nproblem.\n\n= We 100k forward to the continued cooperation of the city in sharing fine\nand conviction information with us, enabling us to take action consistent\n\nwith our AAA program. If appropriate, PM would also support efforts to\nrequire the state or localities to make this information available in a form\nthat enables us to take action consistent with our AAA program.\n\n= We would encourage the city and state to work with PM and the retail\ncommunity to launch an aggressive education and training program to help\neducate retailers and their enployees about the law and give them the tools\nthey need to comply. The We Card program has demonstrated results\n\nin helping\n\nto improve retailer requests for ID, which has been identified as an\neffective tool in preventing sales to minors. We believe that tough\nenforcenent, changes in the law that ensure license suspension for repeat\nviolators along with aggressive education will reduce iilegal sales to minors.",

Minnemeyer\n\nSUBJECT: PMO Status Report\n\nThe major activity on the PMO.project is the continuing long\nterm inhalation study with Beagle dogs at Enviro-Controls' (EC!\nBorriston Laboratory in Temple Hills, Md. Visits by Lorillard\npersonnel, with Dr. Dalhamn, were made on March 9 and September\n26, 1979. Presently, Dr. Tom Nightingale of EC Rockville is the\nproject monitor and Dr. Vince Piccirillo is the project officer\nat Borriston.\n\nSevere technical difficulties observed during the November\n\n16, 1978 site visit have been corrected. At that time eight\n\nPMO dogs had died within a 19 day period, probably attributal to\nPersonnel changes within the laboratory. Since that episode the\nonly death in the PMO group was on March 9, 1979 due to a mechanical\nproblem which was not treatment related.\n\nAt this writing the three groups of PMO dogs are at roughly\n800 to 850 days exposure, while the control groups are passing\n1200 days.

The intended date of sacrifice of the control\ngroups is 1400 days. The PMO group has formal NCI authorization\nto go 1000 days, and an understanding exists that the study might\ngo to 1400 days.

HUMBER\nDATE: December 3, 1984\nSUBJECT: Barclay Strategy\n\nBarclay currently faces the potential of rapidly and\nGramatically eroding situations in the regulatory and legal\nenvironments of a number of countries. Most critical at the\nmoment are Germany, Switzerland, Norway and the U. S. The\nspectre of at least temporary product removal from market in\nseveral situations looms over us. It is currently unknown how\nunilateral legal or regulatory action against Barclay will\naffect its existing franchise or market potential or how it\nwill affect market expansion, but given the potential\nvolatility of legislators, consumer activists and the press, we\nwill be best served by assuming the worst.\n\nIn one form or another, B&W/8-A.T has already put forth many\nrelevant arguments, albeit from a defensive posture. Since\nthis is not working, or is working only temporarily, an\nimmediate, substantive shift in tactics is indicated.\n\nGased on all the legitimate scientific evidence accumulated,\nBaW believes the following (oversimplified for the purposes of\nthis paper):\n\n1. Current testing methodologies were never intended to\nduplicate human smoking conditions, although that {s the\nFevisionist standard under which Barclay is being unfairly\ncriticized and unfairly penalized.\n\n- 2. Current testing methodologies are artificial Yaboretory\nmeasurements based on arbitrary standards (puff volune,\npuff duration, etc.). Deliveries will vary for all.\nCigarettes if those standards are altered.\n\n6eerrotes",

The format\nof the report has remained the same, but market shares are now being\nprovided for the major Newport packings in Chart 15, and Century has\nbeen added to Chart 16.\n\nIndustry sales in January 1984 were low due to the liquidation of\ninventories that had been built up in December because of a price\nincrease and year-end promotions. Consequently, the Industry was down\n4.6% from last year, or -9.0% when allowing for one additional shipping\nday this month.\n\nCompany and brand shares in January fluctuated widely from the December\nlevels as a result of each company's different price increase terms and\nPromotional policies. Philip Morris (39.8) recorded an abnormally high\nshare which offset the December low. American (9.9), Brown & Williamson\n(11.4) and the Liggett Group (6.7) also advanced this month. R.J.\nReynolds ee) suffered the most, falling more than 13 share points.\nLorillard (8.7) was the only other company to experience a share\ndecline.\n\nAll the major brands, except those manufactured by Reynolds and\nLorillard, posted share gains. Marlboro (23.8), B&H 100's (5.6),\nMerit (4.9), Kool (7.3), Generics (5.0) and Pali Mall (4.7) increased.\nWinston (8.6), Salem (5.9), Camel (3.4), Vantage (2.7), Kent (3.5)\nand Newport (2.9) lost ground.\n\nThe \"Official\" Low Tar category (59.4) was down significantly this\nmonth, while the \"Marketed\" Low Tar category (48.6) showed a minimal\ngain. Of the recent brand introductions, Players (.5) improved\nslightly, while Satin (.4) was flat. Century (.7), following last\nmonth's introduction of two new 100's packings, and Marlboro Lights\n100's Box (.4), in its second month in national distribution, decreased\nmarginally.\n\nOf the other major categories, Total Menthol (26.9) and Total 80/85's\n(53.3) fell, while Total 100's (37.8) rose sharply.\n\nper ge\n\nONZzet\nAttachments\n\nETEGSOSFOST",

Each pack has a coupon enclosed\nbeneath the overwrap that is good for \u00a71 toward a carton purchase.\nThis sampling is expected to gain good package trial and offer a\nstrong purchase incentive to smokers of competitive brands. In\nanticipation of the sampling, a retailer mailer would be sent to\npromote the program and alert retailers of the forthcoming $1\n\ncoupon. Additionally, the Sales Organization would book dry carton\ndisplays to assure good display and increased inventory to enhance\ncoupon redemption.\n\nThis special sampling program will be conducted at restaurants,\nmalls and special events, rather than indiscriminate street sampling.\nCareful instruction would be given to the sampling agency at a\nSales/marketing meeting in the N.Y.0. \u2018This would be followed by\nin-market visits by field sales supervisors and N.Y.0, staff to\nassure proper communication of our objective:\n\nScheduling is tight, but workable, and for Sales and Manufacturing\nto implement the program, we require a decision in the week of\nMarch 8 and propose that sampling actually begin in the week of\nmay 14,\n\nThe program cost of $523,318 includes coupon production, a 20%\ncoupon redemption rate, and will be partially offset by U.S.\navings in the sampling markets estimated at $41,000.\n\nIn support of this sampling program, we propose that a schedule of\n\n3 large space 2/color ads be placed 4n the local newspapers. \u2018This\ninvolves an additional investment of $240,000.\nTotal cost: $523,318 Sampling\nrc\nFee -.\nween :\nee OW, ZZEONBG yb\n~ i\noP =\n\nDat.

In addition, many of papers seem to be funded by USEPA, with co-authors are\nfrom various USEPA research labs. It is important to note that at this meeting only the ETS papers\nhhave any co-authors from USEPA,\n\n2. There were fewer papers on IAQ presented at this annual meeting than there had been in the last two,\nThis was clearly disturbing to the IAQ committee members in attendance, However, most felt thatthe\n\nsymposium to be held in late July and the other upcoming 1AQ meetings had a lot to do with the\nreduction in number of sessions.\n\n3.

Norman\n\nSUBJECT: The Effect of Cigarette Side\nStream on Room Air\n\nIt can be shown that the concentration of a smoke\ncomponent in room air at time t is given by:\n\nGap ge oe Fs)\n\nwhere n is the number of cigarettes being smoked, Yo is the\nyield per cigarette, V is room volume, Te is room air exhaust\ntime and Tp is cigarette burning time. The derivation of this\nequation is given in Appendix I. The following assumptions\nare involved:\n\n1. A constant number of cigarettes are being smoked\nall the time.\n\n2. There is complete instantaneous mixing of smoke\nand air.\n\n3. Room air is replaced (not recirculated).\n\nTable 1 summarizes some of the typical sidestream data\ngenerated in our laboratories and also gives OSHA 8 hour\naverage allowable exposure levels.\n\nNow, considering for example a 32m3 room (approximately\n12'x12'x8' which is a comfortable 1-2 man room) and a\ncigarette yielding 7 puffs and 41 mg of Co in the sidestream,\nthe concentration of CO in the room can be calculated as a\nfunction of time and room exhaust time (Te). The results\nof such a calculation are shown in Figure 1. It should be\n\nnoted that the time it takes to achieve equilibrium concentration\n\nis a function of room exhaust time only; the level of equili-\nbrium concentration is a function of the number of cigarettes\nbeing smoked as well as Te.\n\n486L0TTO",

To satisfy this need, Marlboro is\nproviding Spanish language POS, in addition to the regular POS, for each promotion. This\nSpanish language POS provides an opportunity to support stores that have Spanish-\nspeaking adult smokers. Similar to the regular POS, these Spanish POS items use proper,\nnon-colloquial (textbook) language to communicate the offer.\n\nThe following facts about Spanish-speaking adult smokers emphasize the importance of\nSpanish language POS placement during a promotion:\n\n+ Marlboro share among Spanish-speaking adult smokers is 51%.\n\n+ Spanish-speaking adult smokers appear to prefer premium brands,\n\n+ The U.S. is the fifth largest Spanish-speaking country.\n\n+ Hispanics are predicted to be the largest minority group by the year 2010.\n\n+ Buying power of Hispanics is growing; the average weekly grocery spending is above the\nUS. average.\n\n+ Spanish-speaking adult smokers appear to appreciate and prefer to have Spanish\nlanguage POS at retail.\n\nFor August, Marlboro is providing Spanish language POS to support these requests from\nstores that have 25% or greater Spanish-speaking customers. These stores should be\nprovided with the Spanish language POS, in addition to the regular POS that is available for\nthe promotion.\n\nFELbEZz080c",

Ferguson\nRecommendations for Tobacco Identical Flavors Program\nIntroduction\nThis 1986 R&D program has the difficulty, like the International and\nOperations Support Programs, of not directly leading to a new or improved\n\nProduct as its measurable end point. Its \"product\" - an understanding of\n\ntobacco smoke flavor in sufficient depth to enable us to improve tobaccos,\nor the cigarette itself = is a reasonable, supportable objective for an\nindustry leader such as P.M. However, this valid objective is so broad that\n@ wide range of projects can be supported under the banner of \"Tobacco\nIdentical Flavors.\" The problem that this may present management is that it\ntends Ao diffuse efforts into a number of areas when these might better be\ndirected toward solving some specific, product related problems. In order\nto begin to reduce this problem or at least focus these efforts in the most\nProductive areas, I have considered specific R&D program areas where TIF\nactivities can have a favorable effect on success. With this as a guide, I\nthen established short, intermediate, and longer term objectives and let the\nPrograms proposed for this area follow from these considerations,\n\nIn the following section, the short and intermediate term objectives of\nthe program correspond to applications of our research activities to other\nR&D programs. Since the intermediate and long term programs have a longer\nPeriod for completion, specific objectives have been broken out from these\njonger term efforts so that 1986 targets can be set for at least some aspect\n\nof each program. -\n\n\u20ac7190809S02",

Webb\nSUBJECT: New Cigarette Smoking System\n\nPhilip Morris USA and Philip Morris KK (Japan) have announced that they will undertake\nlimited consumer research in the U.S. and Japan on a new cigarette smoking system. The\nnew system consists of a cigarette specially designed to be smoked while partially inside\n\nan electronic Puff Activated Lighter\u2122.\n\nThis new product offers smokers a cigarette with traditional ultra light taste, flavor and\nsmoking pleasure that produces no ashes, dramatically reduces ambient tobacco smoke\nand lingering smoke odor, and only burns tobacco when the smoker draws on it. When the\ncigarette is in the lighter, it also eliminates the potential fire hazard presented by the\nburning end of a carelessly handled cigarette. This new smoking system provides unique\nconsumer benefits while addressing some of the significant social issues surrounding\nsmoking.\n\nBecause this represents a new way to smoke cigarettes, we are undertaking a research\nphase to assess consumer preferences and determine if there is sufficient interest to justify\na test market in the future. We informed the news mecia at this early stage because we\nbelieve that even limited use in public would encourage news coverage on its own.\n\nQuality, choice and innovation have always been the hallmark of our company. As we look\nto the future, we place great value on bringing creativity and new ideas to meet the evolving\npreferences of adult smokers throughout the world.\n\nAttachments: PM-USA Press Release\n\n[COMMUNICATED MS MAIL 10/23/97 10 VPRSS, SSDs, TMPs, TMMs, TMFs,\nINAMs, HRDs, RFDs, SOMs, DMs, DCMs, SAMs, SFLMs, RMSMs, RSAs, RFAs,\nRRs, RTs, HRGs, TMAs, RAAs, SAAs, SMAs, HRAs, RFAssts., SFLAs, ROAs,\n[AND SOAs.

Meyer\n+ Project BETA\n\nThe weekly BETA meeting was held on Friday, July 14, with representatives\nfrom Leaf, Manufacturing Services and R&D.\n\nConsumer testing of BETA 85 was reviewed. VP testing of HTI candidates\n5056 vs. 5059 and 5060 showed that full flavor smokers prefer 5060 over 5056,\nwhile low tar smokers prefer 5059 over 5056. (Table 1) Considering all consumer\ntesting to date, the type of expanded tobacco used in the products tested on\nHTI, and unanswered questions regarding smoke composition flavors, it was de-\ncided to recommend HTI 5056 for initial test market. In the meantime, it was\nrecommended that head-to-head HTI testing of candidates 5056, 5059 and 5060 be\nconducted. It is further recommended that if at all possible, the blends and\ncigarettes be prepared at Stockton Street.\n\nOne VP test is in progress evaluating ET vs. DIET in a Hi-ETA 20% Burley\nblend with smoke composition flavors. A second test of ET vs. DIET using a\nHi ET DBC blend will be shipped early next week. In addition, 2 VP tests of\nHTI candidate $056 vs. True and Decade will be shipped next week. (Table I)\n\nPreliminary readouts of BETA 100 candidates at 9 mg tar with a Hi ET DBC\nblend and a Hi-ETA 20% Burley blend with smoke composition flavors show parity\nvs..Merit 100 with both low tar and full flavor smokers. Based on these results,\nit is recommended that the BETA 100 product be targeted at 9 mg tar and also\ncontain the Hi ET DBC blend similar to the 85 product. (Table I1)\n\nVP testing of BETA Menthol 85 products at 2 different menthol in smoke\nlevels is continuing with preliminary readouts anticipated July 24. (Table III)\n\nIn-house evaluations are continuing on BETA Menthol 85 candidates with\nmenthol applied to the filler and filter. 85 vs. 100 mm cigarettes containing\nthe same blends have been prepared and are scheduled for Descriptive Panel\ntesting next week. Cigarettes have been prepared with ET containing various\namounts of residual ammonia for subjective evaluation. Preliminary analyses\nindicate anmonia in smoke is affected by the percent residual ammonia in ET.\nAging studies will be conducted on these cigarettes to determine ammonia 1oss\nwith time. ET picked from cigarettes used in HTI 5056 testing show a low\nlevel of residual ammonia (0.34%) Based on this information and previous sub-\nJective screening by the Flavor Group, we are recommending that the residual\nammonia level in ET for this product be less than 1%.(Table 1V)\n\nPreliminary specifications for the 85 and 100 mm products have been pre-\npared, specifying a 6 mg tar target for the 85 mm product and a 9 mg tar target\nfor the 100 mm product, both containing a Hi ET DBC blend. Specifications will\nbe transferred to Manufacturing this afternoon.\n\n1000756326",

Proposed pricing is branded discount, enabling\nVirginia Slims to offer the first discounted, female positioned 85mm product.\nThe primary target audience is YAFS 18-24. Qualitative and quantitative testing\nare scheduled in the near future and a test market is recommended for 1/94.\nManagement approval to spend $1.0 mm (for prototype machinery) is required\nto meet this test market date. A recommendation to purchase production\nmachinery for a national launch (1/95) will follow the quantitative test. A\ndetailed marketing plan for the test market will be forwarded after qualitative\nresearch is completed.\n\nThe objective of new Virginia Slims king size is to broaden the appeal ofthe\nbrand among women smokers, particularly women 18-24.\n\nBationale\n\nWhile 40% of all women smokers choose an 85mm cigarette, Virginia Slims\noffers only a 100mm product. Specifically, among YAFS (18-21) the usage of\n85mm products is 60%. Recently, Virginia Slims has demonstrated less appeal\namong YAFS as reported by smoker share. An 85mm version may offer\nVirginia Slims an opportunity to gain smoker share among these YAFS and\nattract other women smokers who previously rejected the brand because of its\u2019\n\nlength.\nbi Ke\n690 6/91 6/92\nWomen smokers 18-21 4 2 3\nprt eT ES\n18-24 9 3 rf\n\nVirginia Slims Kings gives the brand a unique opportunity to offer a discounted\nproduct.

Currently 00% of age 18-\n24 smoke a discounted product, up 00 from year ago.

The modifications deal specifically with changes in tobacco blend\nformulations. We are proposing utilization of PALL MALL Gold leaf, casing and\nflavor formulations for the manufacture of SILVA THINS Filter and LSA-62 leaf\nand casing formulations for SILVA THINS Menthol. By so doing, two tobacco\nblends would be eliminated from factory inventory. For your consideration, we\nare supplying two cartons each of SILVA THINS Filter and Menthol produced to\ncurrent specifications (Control) and two cartons each incorporating the proposed\nmodification (Test).\n\nUtilization of PALL MALL Gold blend in SILVA THINS Filter Cigarettes eliminates\n\na tobacco blend high in BRS-8 stem content (12%) which is pre-cased prior to\nintroduction into the blend. The lower level of BRS-B (5.0%) in PALL MALL Gold\ndoes not require casing prior to introduction into the blend. Cigarette speci-\nfications for the modified product. 1.c., cigarette weight, filter rods, ciga-\nrette paper designation, etc., would remain the same as specified for the current\nproduct. \"Tar\" delivery would remain at 12 mg per cigarette.\n\nTaste panel evaluations of SILVA THINS Filter among 24 in-Company filter smokers\nindicate the following results: Preference - 8 for Test; 8 for Control; and &\nNo Choice. Report card ratings were equivalent for Test (2.55) and Control\n(2.64). There were no statistically significant differences for the other\nspecific characteristics.\n\nCurrently, SILVA THINS Menthol Cigarettes are flavored with menthol and oil of\npeppermint by transfer fron the package foil inner Liner. The proposed blend,\nLsk-62, which does not contain finishing Flavor would utilize the same flavor\nformulation and method of application as current SILVA THINS Menthol. Smoke\ndeliveries of 12-ng \"tar\" per cigarette and 0,05-ng menthol per puff would\nFenain consistent with current specifications.\n\nIn-Company taste evaluation of SILVA THINS Menthol conducted among 19 menthol\nsmokers indicates the following: 7 for test: 6 for Control; and 6 No Choice.\nReport card rating favored Test (2.79) over Control (2.47).

Jennings\n\nFORTUNA C.T. ANALYSIS\n\nThe Fortuna KS produced in the Canary Islands for Spain with Export\nOrder \u00a394670 appears to have been made with an improper blend. I do\n\nnot have any information to determine if there was a problem with the\nblended strip order or due to the total blend (which includes Spanish\n\ntobacco) made in the Canary Islands.\n\nPlease note that on C.I. Analysis #178 dated July 23, the Nobel made\nfrom the sane order had the proper percent total alkaloids and .\nreducing sugars. However, this does not prove that the problem was\nnot due to case variations within the blended strip order or\nvariations in usage of Spanish flue-cured in the Canary Islands.,\n\nThe Spanish flue-cured tobacco is the largest contributor to the\npercentage of reducing sugars in the total blend. 1 might also add\nthat this tobacco is low in total alkaloids.\n\nProblems could exist in three areas:\n\n2/887\not\n\n1, Blend variations in the Spanish flue~cured received from TSA. We\n\nhave very little control of this product, however, I do not\nbelieve that this is the problem because there is very little\nvariation in chemistry between any of the Spanish grades.\n\n2, Blending problems in the Canary Islands. The high sugars and low\n\nalkaloids could be the result of excessive usage of either\nSpanish flue~cured or expanded tobacco. The C.I. analysis \u2018for\n\nthe Fortuna has a puff count of 8.4 and rod density of 0.244 g/ec\n\nwhich in both cases is lower than Marlboro which uses 12% ET\ncompared to 4% ET usage in Fortuna.\n\n3. Excessive Bright usage at 20th Street.\n\nI am aware of blending variations that occur at 20th Street within a\n\nrun and know that they have their share of problems. Run fluctuations\nhave been observed and supportive analysis is available that indicate\n\nthis problem could have originated in Richmond. The management at\n20th Street is avare of these problems and has attempted to improve\ntheir processing uniformity.\n\n28996S000z",

This system will replace the Technicon\n\u2018AutoAnalyzer It (AAI) which is currently being used in these analyses. The Alpkem is\ncontrolled by Alpkem EnviroFlow software and has several other differences from the Technicon\nAAT system.\u2019 An analysis of alkaloids and reducing sugars results generated on both\ninstruments shows that there are slight differences in the data between the Alpkem and\nTechmicon AAI.\n\nAA variety of samples, including the typical sample types analyzed by the method, were run over a\nfour week period on both the Alpkem and Technicon systems. The samples were analyzed using\nthe same extracts on both instruments. The individual sample results from six sets of data were\nentered into an Excel spreadsheet.\u201d The absolute difference and the percentage difference\nbetween the Alpkem result and the Technicon result was calculated for each sample. The\n\u2018comparative data listed in the table below represents the average of the absolute differences and\nthe average of the percentage differences forall the samples analyzed.\n\n\u2018TOTAL ALKALOIDS REDUCING SUGARS\n\u201cAverage \u201cAverage \u201cAverage \u2018Average\nAbsolute | Absolute | Absolute | Absolute\nAlpkem | Alpkem% | Alpkem | Alpkem %\n\nDifference | Difference | Difference | Difference\n\nAverage 0.07 3.76% 02 3.7%\n\nN 217 207\n\n\u2018The results of the comparison show that, on average, the actual results from the Alpkem system\nare slightly higher than the Technicon AATI for both alkaloids and reducing sugars. The actual\ndifference for alkaloids had a range of -0.06 to +0.18 with an average difference of 0.07. The\n\u2018actual difference for reducing sugars had a range of -0.8 to +1.0, with an average difference of 0.1.\nA statistical analysis of the data using the paired t-Test indicates that there is a statistical\nsignificance to the differences between the Alpkem and Technicon AAI, There appears to be no\npractical difference in the reducing sugars results between the two instruments. However, there is\na slight bias towards higher total alkaloids results with the Alpkem.\n\nDOC CODE: PN622\n\n986SZ0rL07",

The objective of this study was to determine the type of\ncellulosic fiber being used\u2019 .\n\nThe Ca fibers and fibrettes in both samples appeared identical (Figures 1-4). A great\nproportion of fibers in sample 277-U were not CA (Ca fibers tend to reflect considerably less\nlight as compared to plant fibers: Figure 5).\n\nSample 277-U was sonicated in acetone for 5 min., rinsed with water, then sonicated in\nwater for 5 min. This process was repeated to remove any CA fibers. The residue fibers were\n0.35-2.65mm long and 8-25y1m wide. Some of these fibers were found to be rounded, not\ntwisting, with blunt ends and no central lumen, node swellings, pits, vessel elements, or\nepidermal cells noted (Figure 6).\n\nThe majority of the residue fibers were flat and not twisting. They had cell walls that\nranged from very thick with the central lumen comprising a minority of the width of the fiber\n(Figure 7), to very thin with the central lumen comprising the majority of the width of the fiber\n(Figure 8). The central lumen was also noted to change width within individual fibers. Since\nthe diameter of the lumen and thickness of the cell walls are not uniform among the plant\nfibers, there may be more than two fiber types present, Both blunt (Figure 9) and tapered ends\nwere noted (Figure 10), with individual fibers sometimes having one blunt and one tapered end.\nNo node swellings, pits, vessel elements, or epidermal cells were noted, Since no pits were\nfound in the fibers, the material is probably not a softwood or a hardwood.\n\nKebsen.

The resistivity ratio specification, however, needs to be:\nchanged as follows me\n\nDefine R, as the resistance of the main filter \u00e9lement and R, as the\nresistande of the groove-orifice route. The resistivity ratto is then\u2019\ndefined as R,/R,. We now find that the general resistivity range should\nbe 0.5 to 5,\" and the preferred range ahould be about 1.0 to 3.0 during\ninitial puffing. The preferred range gives an initial puff main elenect\n\nair flow of 4 to 9 cc/sec for a standard 17.5 cc/sec puff. ay\n\nThe 15 gage, 1.6/24,000 Isc filter, for example, has a resistivity ratio\nof 1.5 and a first puff main element air flow of 7.0 cc/sec. ee\n\nProgranmed Filter Compared to Eastman Slanted Single Groove and Filtrona SCS\n\nEarlier, we discussed the problem of how to show that the program filter\nis radically different from the Eastman single groove filter,",

A possible explanation for this difference could be the\ntransfer of casings between the leaf components and sheet\ncomponents during the Total Blend method of processing.\n\nA test was conducted in the Semivorks to discern any casing\nmovement from the Bright/Burley/Oriental mixture to an RL\ncomponent .\n\nCONCLUSIONS :\n\n\u2018A moderate amount of casing appears to transfer from the e\nBright/Burley/Oriental components to the recon components during\n\u2018Total Blend processing. Changes in sugar levels for this single\n\ntest indicated that approximately 7% of the total casing applied to\nthe leaf fraction transfers to the recon fraction, primarily during\nthe cutting operation. No evidence of a significant casing transfer\nwas found in the fillers produced with separate cut component\nprocessing.\n\nThe results of this test only indicate a potential mechanism for\ntransfer that does not exist with separate component processing.\nadditional testing and analyses would be required to definitively\nquantify the nature and magnitude of casing transfer.\n\n\u2018RECOMMENDATION:\n\nDevelop separate casings through reallocation of existing casings\nto be applied to the RL component in the DCC during NPP separate\ncomponent processing to compensate for the lack of casing transfer.\nInitial evaluations will be conducted in small scale Semivorks\n\nto screen potential casings for Rb prior to verification in large\nscale.\n\n2031158472",

The major achievements are highlighted in the statements which\nfollow. Demonstrated progress was accomplished in several project areas\ncoupled with the expeditious analytical support rendered! at the request of\nR80 projects, other departments of PM USA (notably Leaf and Manufacturing)\nand PM International.\n\nCHARGE NUMBER 1750 - Pyrolysis and Combustion of Tobacco\n\nThe investigations, within the FT-IR laboratory, can be divided into\ntwo main areas: hardware/software developments and applications. In the\narea of hardware/software developments achievements were made by: (1)\nincorporating a new temperature programmer and data acquisition system\nwhich reduced the susceptibility of lost experiments due to computer\ncrashes; (2) upgrading the FTS-14 spectrometer; (3) acquiring a Digilab\nFTS-20E spectrometer; and (4) designing and, fabricating an improved\noptical system for evolved gas measurements. The principal activity of\nthese instruments revolved around the evolved gas technique. In addition\nto this technique, several) applications. to different tobacco systems were\ninvestigated. These applications included: (1) the evaluation of protease\ntreated tobacco; (2) the comparison of experimental\u2019 filler and foamed tobacco;\n(3) the investigation of ammonia carbamate expanded tobacco; (4) the study of\npotassium salt addition on the pyrolytic decomposition of RL base web; (5\n\u2018the evaluation of tobacco carbohydrates; and (6) the study of Ri materials\ndenitrated via enzymatic fermentation.\n\nIn the atomic absorption laboratory, the principal thrust involved the\ndevelopment and application of extraction rate analysis to characterize\ntobacco materials. This effort was directed toward a survey of the use of\nexpanded bright and expanded\u2019 burley in competitors brands. The results\nrevealed a general increase in the use of expanded burley in some competitors\nbrands. In addition, a total blend analysis on Marlboro, Winston and Salem\nrevealed a significant difference in burley and bright composition of\nWinston: versus Marlboro.\n\nIn other studies, the calcium content of tobacco was correlated with\nexpanded cylinder volume measurements. Initial results. were promising and\nwill be extended in the coming year. Changes in the distribution of calcium\nbetween free, cell bound and structural component (pectin) bound: forms were\nobserved for expanded materials relative to suitable control samples.\n\n89zSe22202",

A 20 m filter with\n30 mm overwrap will be the most economical design due to the current machine\navailability situation at Virginie Branch. We anticipate no problens in\nproducing an acceptable model on relatively quick notice.\n\nSULVA THINS 100's\n\nParts have been ordered to enable Durham to expand their capacity beyond that\noriginally anticipated.

Kinser\n\nPreliminary Evaluation of Capillary Gas Chromatography\nof Nitrosamines\n\nCurrent methods of analysis of volatile nitrosamines (VNA) and\ntobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNA) utilize two different packed\ngas chromatographic columns for final separation prior to detec~\ntion by the thermal energy analyzer (TEA). Not only would sample\nthroughput be improved by use of the same column for VNA and TSNA,\nbut a change to fused silica capillary gas chromatography would\nalso minimize chromatographic problems attributed to active sites,\nUnsatisfactory peak shapes were obtained for TSNA samples analyzed\non the capillary columns routinely used in this project\u2019, and\nifficulties with the column itself were experienced with another\ncapillary column recommended for nitrosamine analysis.* A column?\nanalogous to that used by Philip Norris - Europe R&D has been\nrecently acquired. Results for a preliminary evaluation of this\ncolumn are reported below.\n\nThe column used was a 15m X 0.32 mm i.d. DB-1 bonded phase\nfused silica capillary column from J&W (Rancho Cordova, Ca.). No\nattempts were made to optimize operating conditions, Helium was\nused as carrier gas. Injections of standard VNA and TSNA mixtures\nwere performed via the hot needle technique. The Perkin Elmer\nSigma 3B gas chromatograph used in these studies included a split-\nless injector. Detection was by flame ionization detector (FID).\nDetails of the operating parameters are outlined elsewhere. *\n\nFID traces for a TSNA standard are shown in Figure 1. From\nknowledge of the gas chromatographic properties of the TSNA, it\nwas assumed that the later eluting cluster was comprised of the\nthree reference TSNA: N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), N-nitroso-\nanatabine (NAT), and 4-(N-methyl-N-nitrosamino)~1-(3-pyridyl)~1-\nbutanone (NNK). The identities of the earlier eluting components\nare unknown. The conclusions from this initial experiment are\nthat the TSNA can be eluted in a short time period (<20 minutes)\nfrom this column, and that good peak shapes can be obtained.\n\nThe PID trace for a VNA standard is shown in Figure 2. In~\ndividual VNA reference standards of appropriate concentration were\navailable, and their analyses permitted the assignment of peak\nidentifications by retention times, as shown in Figure 2. As with\nthe TSNA, good peak shapes were obtained, and the analysis time\nwas short.\n\nThese preliminary experiments established that we can utilize\na DB-1 bonded phase fused silica capillary column for the analysis\nof reference VNA and TSNA solutions. The analysis times are\n\nPT90zSOS0%",

If it makes sense to use \"ticket\" weights to calculate\nend of week \"in process\" inventory (rather than billed) this will be\nalright but we should run a few trial calculations to make sure.\n\n2. Paperwork on tobacco movement, receiving, etc., is probably ok with\nthe exception of insuring accountability for transfers between the\nlines. (Jerry will look into this.)\n\n3. A list/flow chart is needed of who does what in order to insure tobacco\naccountability is maintained (who inventories, forwards forms to Linda\nAlexander, etc.).

Headspace and Organic Gas Phase Comparison of Carlton (X0PJ) and\nCambridge (XOOY-A) Cigarettes using Chemmetric Techniques.\n\nMay 5, 1980\n\nIn response to a request for assistance from Mr. Warren Claflin, a\nset of headspace and organic gas phase analyses and chemmetric comparisons\nhave been completed. The purpose of the work was to determine differences\nbetween the volatile organic compounds contained in Carlton 0.06 mg. FIC\ntar cigarettes (coded XOPJ) and Cambridge 0.10 mg. FIC tar cigarettes\n(coded X00Y-A).\n\nI, HEADSPACE ANALYSIS-EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS\n\n\u2018The compounds observed in the headspace analysis consisted\nof those retained on a Cambridge filter pad onto which the cigarettes\nhad been smoked. Only the compounds detected by a flame ionization\ngas chromatographic detector after headspace collection and chrom-\ntographic analysis were observed. The conditions under which the\ncigarettes were smoked and the volatiles collected and analyzed are\ndescribed below.\n\nIn order to Imow that the compounds observed were indeed\ndue to the sample in question, several types of control analyses were\nalso performed. These analyses consisted of several types of blank\nsamples associated with smking the cigarettes and performing the\nheadspace collection.\n\n\u2018The cigarettes were smoked in the CI facility using 20-\nPort smking machines under the direct supervision of llr. Eddie\nStagg. Eight Cambridge pads for each brand were held on alternate\nPorts and the remaining four ports held Cambridge pads with no cigarette\nin then, Fifteen cigarettes were smoked onto each Cambridge pad.\nThis process was repeated using unlit cigarettes. The entire operation\nusing lit and unlit cigarettes was then repeated. The Canbridge pad\nholders were opened and the pads of each sample were placed in clean\nglass jars for transfer to the headspace sampling apparatus,\n\n\u2018The eight pads for each sample were subjected to headspace\nsampling as a group. Therefore the headspace samplings consisted of\ntwo for each stoked cigarette, two for each unlit cigarette and one\neach for the total of eight pads smoked with the lit and unlit\ncigarettes. (The four blank pads for each of the two smoking runs\nwere combined for headspace analysis. )\n\n\u2018The headspace sampling procedure consists of placing the\nsample in a specially designed, water-jacketed vessel, sweeping it\nwith an inert gas onto an adsorbent solid, eluting the adsorbent,\nconcentrating it by evaporation, and injecting an aliquot onto the\n\nO02862.2.000T",

Isaacs\u2018 :\nsubject: - Information on Parliament Smokers\n\nThis report summarizes 325 mail interviews of current, first previous\n(last brand) and second previous (2 brands ago) Parliament smokers.\n\nATT r\u00e9spondents' names were drawn from three recently completed PM\nstudies: 1978 Cigarette Tracking (N= 38), Trendex, January 1978\n\n(Ne. 31), and Winona Cigarette Tracking 1978 (N= 256). The object\n\nof the study was to ascertain what current and past smokers of\nParliament think about the product, and the smokers of the brand. From\nthe former users we obtained the same answers (rather than asking\n\nthem to recall why they switched), and tried to deduce their dislikes,\nif any, and their possible reason for switching away.\n\nFINDINGS:\n\n1) Current Parliament smokers have a good image about themselves and\nthe product they smoke.\n\nA third or more of all current Parliament smokers described Parliament\nsmokers as:\n\n\u00ab Independent\n\n+ Fun-loving\n\n+ Open-minded\n\n. Down-to-earth\n\n+ Easy going\n\n+ Intelligent\n\n+ Well organized\n\n+ Neat and tidy\n\n+ Warm x (Tables 1 & 2)\n\n2) Former Parliament smokers have a poorer image of the brand and the\npeople who smoke it. The gap grows greater as people move from\nParliament to another brand and then to a second brand.

Bokelman\n\nSubject: Paper Technology Weekly Summary\n\nTRIM\n\n\u2018Three papers have been ordered! from KC to produce Superslims models at Louisville\nthe week of December 10th. The papers are 47.5 g/m\u2019 before sizing and contain 33% Multifex\nchalk. Target permeabilities are 9, 11, and 13 CORESTA units after sizing with 10.5% mono\nPotassium phosphate. The papers are being made at the Spotswood Mill this week and will be\nsized at the Ancram Mill the week of November 26th for delivery the following week.\n\nMAGNESIUM CARBONATE PAPERS:\n\nAnalytical data were received on four samples of Baymag magnesite ground at Gross\nMinerals after Gross. II. The data strongly suggest that chromium contamination of the\n\u2018magnesite occurred as a function of the. grinding process itself andi was not related! to residual\n\u2018material left in the mill from grinding of the preceding mineral sample.\n\nA meeting was held with Ecusta personnel on November 14 to plan for expeditious\nproduetion (January, 1991) of tonnage quantities of Baymag magnesite having no unacceptable\ncontamination with chromium or other impurities. The most feasible route to meet this\n\u2018objective appears to involve a two-step process: (1) initial! reduction in size from rocks to a\ncoarse sand with a hammer millland then (2) wer grinding (to minimize wear on the grinding\n\u2018medium and its resultant contamination) inva stirred ball mill to convert the coarse sand into a\nfine powder. Zirconia or tungsten carbide media and zirconia liners will be used to avoid\ncontamination problems. A small sample of Baymag magnesite already has, been processed\nthrough a hammer mill and\u2019 submitted for analyses, which are expected! to show that the first\nstep of this process can be accomplished without significant contamination,\n\nRecent experimental work on the optimization of single-filler, natural magnesite paper\nmodels tas led to the following conclusions: (1) increasing the basis weight from 55 g/m\u2019 to\n60 g/m! produces shortened static burn times, (2) the least porous handsheets give the best\nsidestream reductions and the longest static bum times, (3) increasing the sizing content\nappears to improve sidestream reduction and (4) a coresta value of 4 or less may be necessary\nfor optimum sidestream reduction.\n\nDuring the meeting on November 14, Ecusta demonstrated a very interesting new\ncigarette model that uses multiple inorganic paper fillers. Handmade cigarettes had been\nPrepared from a 55 g/m\u2019 handsheet that contained 21% Gross II magnesite, 14% Ecusta regular\nsurface area calcium carbonate and 5.1% of the gel form of magnesium hydroxide.

        "PHILIP MORRIS U. S. A.\nINTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE\nRICHMOND, VIRGINIA\n\n+ Dr. \u00a3. B. Sanders January 15, 1985\n\n+ L. H. Thompson\n\n* The Principles of Mutascreen\u00ae and How It May Be Applied As An\nAlternative for Testing Smoke Products Using Salmonella typhimurium\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nLabsystems, Inc. has introduced a new automated analyzer and assay system\nfor mutagenicity testing called Mutascreen\u00ae. This system is described in the\nattached brochure. If successful, this instrument could replace the standard\nAmes plate test in order to better facilitate test procedures for evaluating\nthe vast number of synthetic chemicals, mixtures, and intermediates present in\nthe environment.\n\nUike the Ames plate test, the Mutascreen\u00ae mutagenicity assay is a\nbacterial test based on the detection of point mutations in Salmonella typhi\nmurium. However, other bacteria such as E. coli, can also be used. The\nprototrophic growth: of cells which were originally auxotrophic is an: indicator\nof the presence of mutagens in both systems. The difference is that the Muta-\nScreen\u00ae assay also monitors kinetic properties associated with the incubation\nmixture, while in the Anes assay, the endpoint consists of bacterial colonies\nthat are counted after an incubation period.\n\nSeveral articles have acknowledged the potential usefulness of a\n\u201ccomputerized Ames test\", but investigators are being very cautious before\nendorsing it. This is especially understandable since Labsystems Inc. admits\nthat so far there are limited data to back up its claim that Mutascreen\u00ae\nindeed can replace the standard Anes test for evaluating chemicals. 1s?\n\nSince Mutascreen\u00ae was introduced in early 1983, PM personnel have moni-\ntored its progress. Prototypes of Mutascreen\u00ae have been observed at the\nEnvironmental Mutagen Society (EMS)? and the Society of Toxicology (SOT)\nmeetings.* In addition, more information has been obtained through phone\nconversations\u00ae and visitations at PM from Labsystems Inc. representatives. \u00ae\nLabsystems Inc. plans were to place 10 Mutascreens\u00ae in \"respected\" labs\naround the world, including two in the U.S. -the Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA) and SRI International - for independent evaluations.\u2019 After\nthese evaluations, it was hoped that Mutascreen\u00ae would be purchased by other\nJabs. The target date for completion of both evaluations and subsequent\npurchase orders was May 1, 1984. Since that time, problems have arisen that\nhave prevented the fulfillment of these expectations. \u00ae\n\nThe purpose of this memo is two-fold: first to give an overview of the\nPrinciple of Mutascreen\u00ae, and secondly to give a status report outlining the\ncriteria needed to be met in order to justify purchasing the analyzer for use\n\naun 2060457803",

Weissbecker\n\nSUBJECT: Visit with Dr. Paul Kotin, Director, Environmental Health\nSciences Center on October 20, 1967\n\nMy visit with Dr. Kotin was most informative and we were able to\ndiscuss a wide range of topics.\n\nHe is quite excited about contract research being done for them\nconcerning free radicals in cigarette smoke. The investigation\n\nis centered around stable free radicals which resist chemical\ntreatment and are still detectable after condensate fractionation,\nThey are in the polynuclear hydrocarbon fraction. Kotin believes\nthe free radicals are attached to smoke particles. They can be\ndetected until they are applied to tissue whereupon they disappear\nand are believed to have reacted. The work has been confirmed and\nseveral research contracts in this area have been funded.\n\nHe showed me the latest report from FDRL. The majority of the work\nconcerned\u2019 injury potentials of the trachea and the development of\nsuitable electronic amplifiers. There was also some work on mucus\nviscosity. He wanted to know if we planned to do any work on the\ncomposition of mucus and alterations due to cigarette smoking.\nDespite some of his earlier publications linking smoke particulate\nmatter and muco-ciliary inhibition, he is now convinced that gaseous\nconstituents are the prime inhibitors, He still believes that the\ncholinergic system is the prime regulator in lung clearance and\nintends to investigate the effect of cigarette smoke on the para-\nsympathetic nervous system.\n\nDr. Kotin believes that Wynder's work is reliable because they have\nbeen able to reproduce the skin painting experiments and obtain the\nsame results, at least qualitatively if not quantitatively, Hie\nstrongly disagrees with Wynder that nitrate addition to cigarettes\nis the panacea claimed by Wynder. He feels there is too much danger\nfrom the oxides of nitrogen.\n\nThey are just beginning with their electron spin paramagnetic and\nNMR instruments for free radical work. Future work at their labs\nwill include investigation of the effects of cigarette smoke on\nalveolar toxicity. macrophage viability and phagocytic action, and\neffects on the endothelium and lung surfactant. He also expressed\ninterest in carcinogenic lactones and epoxides. Most of the cancer\nwork will be done at Bethesda although they will do skin painting\ntests at Durham.\n\nOSE0TTO00b",

Very recently, however, nicotine\ndeliveries have slightly exceeded our imposed limit of 1.04 mg. This\nwas caused by the phase-in of 1983 burley, which is unusually high in\nnicotine. The peak has now been passed, and weekly smoke data\nindicate that the nicotine numbere are declining. By December,\nnicotines should again be on target.\n\nTo meet the new regulation limits, some rather extensive product\nchanges wili be required. We have considered longer tippings, higher\nventilations, increased filter efficiencies, cigarette paper change\nand blend changes.\n\nIn a conversation, Tony Cousins told me that BATUXE's approach, at\nthis time, centers around blend modifications to reduce nicotine and\nincreases in ventilation.

The IVR calls consist of those callers who\ncalled into the Opt Off VR, experienced problems and were transferred to a live CSR at PRC.\n\n\u2018The large decrease in Opt Off calls is primarily due to the change in the prompts that Kathy McMahon\nimplemented, which originally placed PRC as the first prompt when a caller decided to get out of the\n\u2018Opt OMFIVR. \u2018The majority of these callers were Marlboro consumers. Additionally, PRC has changed\ntheir operating procedure regarding calls that were normally transferred to Consumer Affairs (..\nDeceased, Wrong Name etc.). PRC will handle all alls that are associated with Opt Off, with the\nexception of consumers stating anything in regards to legal counsel, in order to prevent an excessive\namount of transfers to Consumer Affairs.\n\nAlthough the call volumes were excessive, PRC maintained a high level customer service and only\nminimally deviated from the contract standards.\n\nIfyou should have any questions, please feel free to give me a call\n\nOrzeogogoz",

Please note there\n\nare some enhancements currently in progress for VERSATILE.\nThe demo was presented by Kevin Zasio along with Jean\nRaudenbush of INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SPECIALIST, INC.\n\nArthur DeBaugh, Hunton & Williams, informed us that Philip\nMorris\u2019 Legal Department has offered to purchase six\nVERSATILE software packages and that the NYO Records\nManagement Department will be receiving one. However, he\nalso stated that any training or additional hardware\nrequired would be absorbed by the individual department.\nBased on the demo, I recommend we at least try this software\nonce received. If all goes well I would then recommend\nupdating our current Records Management System to VERSATILE\nand training all RM staff members.\n\nOur current Records Management system is good, but utilizing\nVERSATILE would enhance daily transactions/information as\nwell as produce more accurate and faster space studies i.e.\nin a matter of hours vs. many months of manual labor as is\ncurrently underway at the Carlstadt.\n\nAgain, I highly recommend VERSATILE for its flexibility and\n\nthe fact that is is very diversified, however, experience is\nthe best teacher.\n\nThere was no literature available on VERSATILE at the\nmeeting; however, I asked J. Raudenbush to please fax\nliterature on VERSATILE which I will review and submit for\ndiscussion with B. Jones.

Houniner\n\nSubject: HCA in Adhesive\n\nAs part of our continuing interest in encapsulation technologies to\nprovide a tool for a control release of flavors, we have reevaluated the\nconcept of encapsulation of a-HCA in sideseam adhesive. The major advantage\nof this approach is its application to sidestream flavoring.\n\n\u2018The addition of G-HCA to adhesive appears to yield a uniform emulsion\n(solution) which seems to be stable over time. No separation of the HCA was\nobserved even after three months. 0.5% and 1.5% w/w solutions of a-HCA in\nadhesive were prepared and used in the Semi-vorks production of Marlboro\nLights cigarettes. The cigarettes were analyzed for a-HCA content and were\nsmoked on the prototype CORESTA machine to determine a-HCA in both mainstream\nand! sidestream smoke. The analyses were carried out in the Analytical\nResearch Division by $. $. Yang and A. Charles on both fresh cigarettes\n(December 1991) and aged\u2019 cigarettes (april 1992). A memo relating to these\nanalyses is attached.\n\n\u2018The results indicate that the cigarettes made from 0.5% w/w a-HCA in\nthe adhesive contain \u201cstable\u201d a-HCA in the sideseam. They also indicate that\n\nfiller. Moreover, this stability was maintained over a period! of three\n\nSoe is aes ce cae oy es nena ete\nCie\n\nmonths, as demonstrated by both the small loss of a-HCA and the similar\n\nTevala far Sch douse al tl mndasi ceed and \u2018dictet sean suske}) Cigarettes Hie\n\nprepared from the higher concentration (1.5%) showed significant transfer of\n\nG-HEA to flller, However, this redistribution of flavor on the cigarettes yW/ys\n\ndid not change much after three months.\n\nPerhaps the most important conclusion of this study is the effective\nencapsulation of a-HCA in sideseam adhesive which leads to the delivery of a~\nHCA mainly to sidestream during smoking.\n\nWe believe the above study should! be repeated to determine whether this\n\u2018encapsulation into the sideseam adhesive is indeed an additional method for\nrelease of a-HCA to cigarette sidestream smoke.\n\nDistribution:\n\nc.

Lance Tarrance & Associates performed a survey\non voter attitudes towards the upcoming smoking regulation initiative in\nCalifornia. The results indicated substantially weaker support for the\ninitiative than indicated by other research (VLT in January, Claritas in ~.\nMay, Field in July). Our July survey showed 56% in favor and 41% opposed\nto the initiative. By comparison, the results of our January survey showed\n72% in favor and 24% opposed.\n\nSeveral likely sources of explanation offer themselves that might accouat\nfor this shift. In the first place, the sample might have been off. This\npossibility is unlikely in view of the similarities between this sample\nand our own earlier samples, both the January study, and our various\nsurveys for the Proposition 11 campaign.

Fenner.\n\nSubject: Commuter Train Air Sampling in New York city.\n\n\u2018The following is a summation of air sampling tests conducted on\ncommuter train lines in New York City during the week of September 6, 1987.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\nAll air sampling was done using the PASS briefcase system designed by\nR, J. Reynolds. Two project team members were used on each train tested.\nOne member sampled the train car designated as the \u2018smoker\u2019, while the\nSecond member sampled an adjacent \u2018non-smoker\u2019 car. Testing was performed\nto obtain a sample representative of the entire train car by sampling from\nan aisle seat as near to the center of the train car as possible and away\nfrom the direct influence of ventilation sources. The target sampling time\nfor each train was one hour with actual collection times ranging from 49 to\n73 minutes. A total of 16 cars were sampled representing the Harlem,\nHudson, Long Island, and New Haven train lines. The measurements made\nincluded nicotine, respirable particulate matter and carbon monoxide.\n\nRESULTS\n\n\u2018The average concentration of nicotine found was 43 g/m? for all smoker\ncars sampled and <1 jig/m\u2019 for the non-smoker cars. To illustrate the\nexposure to nicotine received by an individual, \"cigarette equivalent\u201d is\noften used. This calculation is based upon the human respiration rate and\nthe sales weighted average nicotine delivery of market cigarettes. The\n43 g/m? nicotine concentration corresponds to 0.02 \"cigarette equivalents\u201d\nPer a one-hour train ride in a smoker car. Restated, this means that a\nPerson would require 50 one-hour train rides in the smoker car to be exposed\nto the equivalent of one cigarette.\n\nPART: 2\n\nThe average concentration of RSP measured in the smoker cars was\n493 lig/m\u2019, while that for the non-smoker was 35 jig/m?.\n\n\u2018CARBON MONOXIDE\n\nThe average levels of CO found over a one hour sampling time ranged\nfrom 1 to 11 ppm for all cars sampled with the ranges for the smoker and the\nnon-smoker cars of 3-11 ppm and 1-3 ppm, respectively. An interesting\nfeature, however, was observed when the CO concentrations were examined as a\nfunction of time during a train ride. The levels of CO in a train car were\ngenerally higher (often by a factor of two times) when the car was leaving\n\nsozaseezoe",

These\nvalues were obtained with tover feeds containing about 2% soluble\namtonia and 2-3% moisture,\n\nseyagltboratony scale studies have, shovn that, in general, lover\neying tenperatures at longer tines give better expansion,\naulking the dried sample for several hovre (sealed) before\nexpansion also gives some inprovencat. The highest equilibriva\ncylinder volume obtained so far is 76 ce/10g at 10.6% 0.V. This\nSiterial was obtained by. deying a 6% ammonia inpregnaced drighe\nFiller.

Presumably BIGIF\nthat's also 40\u00a2 off should move through in relative decent time.\n\nWe are pulling the menthol product from the marketplace that was\nproduced before August, 1992. This shouldn't be a lot of product\n(frankly, we didn't sell a lot to begin with). But this will eliminate\nreally stale product as well eliminate any from the alcohol\nfermentation batch.\n\nNet- we're back under control.\n\nAs part of our brand review w/o 5/3, we'll talk our options to\nswitch to anew (Long/Short) B&H strategy.\n\nOSPSSFSEOE -",

When this rod is fed to a making\nmachine/FTA combination, an individual cigarette of Material\nA/Material B tobacco section is produced. The method used to\nproduce such a rod on the Molins D.A.P.T.C, machine is thus:\n\nA filter hopper feeds sections of filter plug Material A\nto a suction tape. The speed of this suction tape is such\nthat a space or gap is obtained between the Material A\nfilter plug sections. A second filter hopper is used to\nfeed filter plug sections of Material B, and this section\nis placed in the gap between the two sections of Material A.\nDownstream from the filter hoppers a closing device crams\nthe sections of filter plugs into a continuous rod of Mate~\nrial A/Material B formation, Using established methods,\nthis rod is wrapped with paper, sealed and cut to desired\nlengths, These cut lengths of filter rod Material A/Mate~\nrial B formation are then fed to a making machine/FTA com-\nbination to produce a cigarette as earlier described. The\nsections of Material A/Material B do not necessarily have\nto be the same length or made from the same material.\n\nBy using two Molins D.A.P.T.C, machines and feeding the dual\ntype filter rods produced by one machine into one hopper of\nthe second machine, a triple type flush filter per individual\ncigarette can be obtained.\n\n5 It is understood that one version of the Molins D,A.P.T,C.\nmachine can produce a filter plug of Material A/gap/Material\nA. This filter rod, when fed to a making machine/FTA combi-\nnation, will produce a mouthpiece or recessed type filter\nper individual cigarette.\n\nour desixed filter plug per individual cigarette is Material A/\ncharcoal granules/Material B. To produce this filter plug, it\n$e\"intended to use the method earlier described to feed sec=\ntions of filter plug Material A/Material B alternatingly onto\n suetion tape. \u2018The cramming method as previously described\nwill be retained, but the receiving tape will be speeded up.\n\n682234104",

More recent work has indicated that\nthe injection port sample split has been causing the poor\nPrecision. Table 1 shows the results from analyzing the\nsame sample with and without the split. Not only did the\nresults appear to be more precise without a split but also the\npercent d-menthol found in the samples was greater. \u2018The\napparent effect of splitting on the relative amounts of the\nesters detected was unexpected, since they were diastereomers.\n\nThe percent d-menthol found in racemic menthol samples\nappeared to be low. The optical rotation of 0\u00b0 indicated 508\nd-menthol, however only 46.8% was found using the chrysanthemic\nacid procedure. While contemplating this problem, it was noted\nthat if the unknown peak shown in Figure 1 was included in\nthe area of the d-menthol ester peak the percent d-menthol in\nFacemic menthol would be 50.5%. There is no data to support\nthis calculation, however it does indicate a need for\nidentifying the unknown component. :",

The development of the anaerobic fermentation process up\nthrough pilot plant was completed and preliminary plant\ndesigns were made. ecto\n\n3, The initial major phases of installation of the DEC computer\nnetwork were completed on schedule.\n\n4. The Barclay cigarette was analyzed to determine filter\nperformance.\n\n5. Our technical assistance allowed the production laser\nperforation systems to be brought on stream.\n\n6. In collaboration with Cetus Corporation, fractions of\ncellulase enzyme were obtained and tested for efficacy\nin improving the expandability of tobacco. Water activity\neffects (see item 1) were recognized as a contribution to\nthis process and plans were made to reevaluate the conmer-\ncial feasibility of increased expandability.\n\n7. A number of tests were devised to explore the performance\nof adhesives and eyaluate bonding properties.

To\nmonitor public anti-smoking sentiment, a series of questions was asked of 3,000\ncurrent cigarette smokers and 5,426 non-smokers as part of our National Continuous\nTracking Study. These interviews were conducted from October 1, through\nDecember 16, 1990. The first four questions in this series have been included in our\nstudies since 1987.\n\nBecause of the high percentage of smokers and non-smokers who strongly or\nsomewhat agree that being around people who are smoking poses a health hazard, two\nadditional questions were added to the study starting in 1988,\n\nOVERVIEW\n\n\u2018The campaign for non-smokers\u2019 rights continues to be very effective. The single\nconsistent exception has been the anti-smoker's inability to create support for the\nidea that non-smoking should be a criterion for employment. Currently, 89% of\nsmokers and 76% of non-smokers disagree with the idea that it's all right for an\nemployer to refuse to hire a smoker. These numbers have changed little over time.\n\nEmployment Refusal\nSmokers Non-Smokers\nSpring Winter \u2018Spring Winter\nAgree 10% _9% 8% 7% 8% 27% 20% 22% 21% 20%\nStrongly 4 4 3 3) 3) 32\u00b0 10) 11 10> <9\nSomewhat 7 5 5 5 5 16 10 11 10 10\n88 88 89 91 89 69 74 73 74 76\nSomewhat 17 9 10 10 9 33 29 29 30 28\nStrongly 71 79 80 81 80 36 45 44 45 47\n\nAmong non-smokers, more men than women, and more older respondents than\nyounger ones, agreed with the notion that employment restrictions should be placed\non smokers.\n\nNon-smokers in smoking households continue to be more sympathetic to the needs of\nsmokers than are non-smokers living in non-smoking households.\n\n(Tables 1-17)\n\nzoseosovoz",

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE\n720 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10017\n\nTO: Carl Cohen DATE: March 23, 1993\nFROM: \u2014 Yvette Rodriguez\nSUBJECT: Hispanic Strategy Qualitative Test\n\nThe following summarizes findings from the qualitative advertising test conducted among\nVirginia Slims and competitive Hispanic female smokers on February 16 to March 2, 1993.\nThe main purpose of this research was to assist brand in developing an appealing and relevant\ncampaign geared to Hispanic female smokers. The full presentation is attached.\n\nBackaround/Methodology\n\nThe objectives of this study were to develop a better understanding of Hispanic women's\ndefinition of femininity and to explore Virginia Slims and competitive smokers\u2019 reaction to an\nartay of advertisement directions. The ads shown had three directional themes: lifestyle (Fruit\nCase, Walk the Dog, Swept Away, Rappers and Motorbike), formalitraditional femininity\n(Vellum single and spread) and casual femininity (Mary Mize in Leather Jacket and Honey in\nLeather Jacket). Color copies of the ads are appended.\n\nA total of 85 interviews (one-on-ones, paired, and triads) were conducted among Virginia Slims\nand competitive smokers in New York, Miami, and Los Angeles. Forty-five interviews were\nconducted among 18-24 year old smokers (21 Virginia Slims and 14 competitive smokers) and\nforty among 25-34 year old smokers (19 Virginia Slims and 21 competitive smokers),\nRespondents were shown the nine ads in randomized order. In addition, alternate copy was\ntested in selected markets.\n\n\u2018Summary\nNo one execution was a clear winner. The findings are predominantly directional in nature. ._.>\nBrand Imagery cael ret\nae\n\n+ All the smokers interviewed associated Yroinia Sirs wih sophistication,\nelegance and femininity. Therefore, th\u00e9 femininity theme seems to be a relevant\nand Teaningful way to talk to these smol ticularly Virginia Slims smokers)\nabout the brand.\n\n+ By in large, most of these women did not view smoking as an exclusively\nmasculine activity. Some viewed smoking as a way to enhance their femi\n(Virginia Slims smokers); for others it was an androgynous activity (compe\nsmokers).\n\nyetetvog",

Louise reviewed studies of the product\nwith respect to vapor/particulate split. The Low Density Rod did not appear\nto produce a higher vapor phase on a puff by puff basis. Louise continued\nby presenting data on comparison of a \u00a7 mg Low Density Rod versus expanded\ntobacco. Data indicate that the Low Density Rod had a lower resistance to\ndraw, Studies were conducted using nonporous paper at 7.2 mg per cigarette\n(FTC tar) with a control at 7.6 containing a high level of expanded tobacco.\nMs. Wu indicated that there were problems with quality and over casing of\nthe samples. Plans are to repeat the study and conduct subjective testing.\nAdditional data was presented on the Low Density Rod using a 35% magnesium\nhydroxide paper versus a Marlboro, Reduced sidestream visibility using this\nparticular magnesium hydroxide paper was achieved. Smoke chemistry studies\nwere also conducted using nonfiltered rode. A full flavor blend was cased\nbut had no aftercut. A total of 30 different analyses vere conducted; the\nresults were qualitative. There appeared to be a tendency toward higher\ncomponents in the Low Density Rod, which may be due to the pectin binders\nused in producing the product.\n\nRobert Mullins was introduced and presented the status of the\ndevelopment efforts. Robert indicated that three new steps had been\nimplemented in the process since the last quarter. These include steaming,\na drying step using a microwave oven chamber, and an air cooling step.\nRobert reported that the Mark 8 has been modified to implement the new steps\nnoted above. In his opinion the major accomplishments have been redesign of\nthe microwave cavity to increase speed to 2,000 cigarettes per minute,\ndesign of an ultrasonic nozzle for atomization or moisture addition and\nupdating the drawings to zeflect the current process. Robert also reported\nthat an economic analysis was conducted, and excluding capital investment to\ninitiate the Low Density Rod in the factory, the savings would be 31 cents\nper thousand cigarettes based on a reduction of 25% in density. Robert\nreviewed the current strategy for the Low Density Rod program and included\nthe following steps: optimize understanding of the process; develop\nspecifications for scaleup; continue sample production; continue to refine\nthe process with the microwave cavity and moisture addition steps; and begin\nto assess alternate processes, particularly for on-maker binder application.\nRobert indicated that, should justification for the product be sufficient,\nthe target date for technology transfer to PM USA Engineering, QA, Quality\nEngineering, and Manufacturing could be as early as the third quarter 1989.\n\ncomes eo CONFIDENTIAL",

        "PHILIP MORRIS U. 8. A.\nINTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDE\nRichmond, Virginia dot pears\n\nTo: .Dr, A. H. Warfield August 31, 1989\n\nFrom:  .W. R. Morgan and S. A. Haut\n\nSubject: Inhibition of Pyrosynthetic 7SNA Production by Oriental CEL\n\nIt has long been speculated that a component or components in oriental\nfiller suppress the formation of endogenous and pyrosynthetic TSNA. This is\nevidenced by the very low levels of TSNA in both oriental filler and smoke.\"\nRecent observations support this hypothesis. The addition of nitrate to\noriental filler does not significantly increase MS smoke TSNA levels as does\nnitrate addition to bright filler, further supporting the hypothesis of\npyrosynthetic inhibition of TSNA format.on in oriental MS smoke. A130,\nblending of oriental filler with burley filler does not yield a reduced\nlevel of TSNA in MS smoke from the burley f:ller, indicating that the\nsuppressing effect is not readily tran:ferable to surrounding filler.\u201d\n\nTo further investigate the inhibitory effect of oriental filler\ncomponents on pyrosynthetic SNA fo:mation, CEL\u2018s from DBC burley (Bu) and\nblended oriental (Or) feedstock wer mixed (Bu/OrCEL) and applied to burley\nbaseweb (BuBW).\u2018 This method of application was chosen in order to obtain\nthe maximum interaction between the components from the two fillers.\n\nTable 1 gives a comparison of the MS smoke results for Bu/OrCEL on BuBW,\nburley CEL (BuCEL) on BuBN, and oriental CEL (OrCEL) on BuBW.*\n\n\u2018The level of CEL addition in samples 1, 2, and 4 was 45% by weight.\nFor sample 3 the CEL addition was 22.5%. .Sample 4 is a 50/50 mixture of\nCEL\u2018s? thus the amount of BuCEL is equal to that of sample 3 and 1/2 that of\nsample 1. All cigarettes were made to a weight that contained the same\namount of BUBW regardless of the overspraying regimen.\n\nSample 2, OrCEL on BuBW, shows very low MS deliveries of NNN and NAT\nbut a rather substantial MS delivery of NNK. The NNK originates primarily\nfrom the BuBW rather than the CEL used to prepare the RL. This has been\npreviously observed in MS smoke from cigarettes made from 100% BuBN and is\nillustrated in Table 1.\u00b0 In order to study the NNK contribution to MS smoke\nfrom the applied CEL, the NNK contribution from the BuCEL to the total MS\nNNK was calculated and called \"BuCEL NNK\". This value is shown in column 4\nof Table 1 and is calculated by subtracting the NNK value for sample 2 (the\nBuBW NNK contribution) from the total NNK value for each sample. This\ncalculation should be valid since sample 2 has been prepared using OrcEL and\nany CEL effects to BuBW MS NNK delivery should be accounted for. Also all\ncigarettes made for this study contain a constant amount of BuBW.\n\nThe TSNA amounts given in Table 1 for sample 3 should be approximately\n1/2 the amounts for sample 1 and the amounts for sample 3 and 4 should be\nequal if no inhibitory effect from OrCEL exists. As can be clearly seen in\nTable 1, the proposed reductions in NNN and NAT were observed in sample 3\nrelative to sample 1 and additional reductions were achieved for sample 4\n\nETLST9E9OZ",

Alter\nSUBJECT: Players Lights 25's Market Check\n\nThe purpose of this memo is to report the findings of a Players\nLights 25's market check and to offer recommendations for the\nupcoming test expansion. The check of 52 retail outlets was\nconducted in Denver and Des Moines on August 20-21 with J.\nSpector, and B. Johnson of Leo Burnett. This time period\nrepresents the 12th week of the introductory period and the end\nof a flight of weekly coupon drops (FSI's).\n\nIn Denver, share is estimated to be more than 0.5% and even\nhigher in Des Moines, reflecting data reported by Market\nResearch. Of course, these figures are being driven by the\nlatest coupon drops. In both markets, the 100's packing seems\nto lead the KS version in carton outlets. The split is 50/50 in\npack outlets.\n\nDistribution/Availability\n\nDenver - Distribution is significantly limited by \u2018our failure to\nwin Safeway authorization. Discounting the Safeway gap,\ndistribution is approximately 80%; in such major chains as 7-11,\nproduct availability is spotty and some outlets still do not\ncarry the brand.\n\nDes Moines - Distribution is better here, although product is\nnot yet available in Casey's, even though it has been authorized\nby headquarters. Many out-of-stock situations were noted,\npresumably caused by a failure at retail to anticipate the\nsteady coupon activity and build inventory levels.\n\nVisibility/Pos\n\nDenver - POS usage was very low and consisted of a few remaining\nContract I and special pieces from the June-July period, and\nonly a few small B headers representing the Contract II August\nmaterial. There were virtually no posters or set/sells. In a\nfew cases, the 2-pack incentive display was still in use; there\nwere no (wallet) carton displays seen, nor the 30-carton\nmini-bin. In a majority of the eight 7-11 stores visited, all\nproduct was kept in the back room and was available only upon\nFequest. Apparently, Players was not yet on the \"lay-out\" plan\nfor the carton rack in most 7-1l's.\n\nP0zztog\u00a292",

Depending on\nwhere the surveys are being mailed from, and where they are being mailed to, it could take another three\nto five days before the surveys actually arrive at the data entry supplier(s). Finally, it takes\napproximately three weeks for responses to get loaded to the PM database from the time they are\nreceived at the data entry supplier. In total, from the time a survey is filled out until the time it gets\nloaded to the database, the timing would be around five to six weeks.\n\nOur next response report will be issued the week of February 28th, which will reflect activity as of the\nFebruary 23rd database update.\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to call.\n\n@S0144H0z",

The primary reason was to offset\nsome rate increases in other maga\u00a2ines plus a rate increase in\nU.S. Tobacco Journal. In view of the fact that we had the\nheaviest schedule in U.S. Tobaccb Journal and this was the second\nrate increase quoted to us in twp years, we could afford to reduce\nthe number of insertions in U.S. Tobacco Journal,\n\nthe xeduction of seven insertions reduced our total expenditure\nin U.S. Tobacco Journal by $845 and this is what disturbed Mr.\nBreitman, He pointed out to me that we have enjoyed a reduced\nrate in their book for many years. As an example he did furnish\nme with placement orders from other cigarette manufacturers which\njustify his position (see attached). Our rate in 1970 was $185 per\npage and the 1971 rate will be $200 per page.\n\nunder the circumstances, I recommend that we extend our cooperation\nby taking an additional three insertions in U.8. Tobacco Journal\n\nat a total cost of $600. Sufficient funds are available in the\nbudget to cover the expenditure.\n\nce: Miss M. V. Timlen\n\nMr. J. F, McDermott",

For\ncomparison, we have also included a scenario with more typical PM USA pricing (9.3%\nannually). In both cases, a total DME spending pattern was chosen that maximizes PM\nUSA\u2018s total net contribution over the five vear period. Note that the scenario with\ninflaton-level pricing generates $1,225.2 million more net contribution during the period\nand 12.6 billion more premium units in 1997 than the higher, typical PM USA pricing\nscenario.\n\nPlease note that our model is based on historical data from 1986-1991 and, therefore,\nimplicitly assumes that elasticities, marketing efficiencies and competitive responses are\nsimilar during the 1993-1997 period. Accordingly, the model assumes that competitors\ncontinue to follow whichever pricing strategy we choose.\n\nPRICING\n\nIn both scenarios, we assumed that premium and BPV prices would increase $2.50 in\nNovember and $2.00 by January. Also, in both cases BW/PL net contributions are\nconservatively assumed to increase only $2.00 per year through 1997 and PM USA's\nBW/PL volume increases only 5.0 billion units per year during the period.\n\nDME\n\nIn both scenarios, we assumed PM USA's total DME spending in 1993 would be $1,946.0\nmillion, In order to maximize five year net contribution with inflation-level pricing, DME\nspending \u2018On the other hand, if PM USA\nincreases premium prices 9.5% per year, we would have to i\n\n\u2018year to maximize five year net contribution, Note that if the relevant time horizon were less.\nthan five years, we would spend less in DME each year under both scenarios.

They wanted a CP? with\nat least two products, national production and retail availability in\nabout three mnths. Ambitious - yes, inposedble \u2014 no-\n\nIn April 1978, RSD recommenced for test two 100 mm candidates for testing\nagainct masked Merit 100 (\u00a5E1978-69/70), The producte were elongated\nversions of two tested King Size products. Iwo flavore (XFF-149 and\nXFF-135) were used on XLF-228. Preference parity was achieved with =ke\nKPF-149 flavor, the flavor/Uleud coubiaation im RALEIGH Lights KS.\n\nProduction of thie brand otarted the firet veck in June 1978 with only\nslight difficulties, Seversl Factory Trials were required to fine-tune\nthe design and the product was out the door --- only one week off schednla.\n\nDue to the fact that the Rich Lights launch was several months after\nRALEIGH Lights, product improvement vas initiated for VICHROY Rich Tights\n100. Similer to the KS yereion, the blend was changed to XLP-256 (one\nhogshead CA burley/normal mix WIS). In July 1978, R\u00e9D recommended three\nAmprovenent products. 1F=265 with two newly developed flavors an\u00e9\nKLF-259 (ARCTIC LIGH=S blend) with a thizd flavor went out to be tested\nversus masked Merit L00's (MRLY7B-96).\n\nResults shoved only one proaising candidate, XLF-266/XFF-173. Movever,\nthis product showed very little inprovenen: over the curzeat product which\nachieved preference parity in the initial test. Thus, it ves decided chat\nthe VICEROY Rich I4ghts/EALELGH Lights 100 not be changed.\n\nThis project wco given another attempt at inprovoncnt under tho SPIRIT\nbamner. Ageia, three new products were developed and teared in a round\nrobin with the current product (MRI978-164). At last, ve had gotten noz\none, but two superior products. The BELATA K3 blend/KP?-182 had scored\n@ significant preierence win over current while XLF-271A/KFF-16/ scored\na directional vin.\n\nWhile riding igh oa chis wave, the SPIRIT project was abandoned. How\never, ali was not lost; uo still have sone gooe product. Fecause of\nthe excellent test results, consideration was given to changing Rich\nLights 100's to che BELAIR XS blend product without any further testing.\nSeveral protleas (eg., no ET-1 in Louisville) would have becn encoun\ntered Iu making the change earlier this year, so Rich Lights 100'\nremained unchanged.

A definitive\nreport on the non-dispersive microprobe work so far is to be prepared and\ndistributed (Carter, Hasegawa).\n\nResults of neutron activation analysis were inconclusive because of erratic\nbackground contributions from the Whatman No. 4 filter paper substrate; this\nwork is to be repeated with samples on thin films of carbon (Newman, Jenkins,\nCarpenter). 7\n\u2018Two new approaches to the demonstration of chemical\u2019 constitution of size fractions\n\nwere incorporated: chemical microscopy is to be investigated (Hasegawa) and also\nPhotoelectron spectroscopy (Crump), The latter technique was suggested as a means\n\nof avoiding the substrate problem, while affording sensitive chemical discrimina~\n\ntion (Lowitz).\n\nIt was pointed out that no size-composition correlation beyond that described\n\nby the Gibbs-Thomson: equation is to be expected in the highly-aggregated smoke\nwhich issues from the cigarette (Hartung, Simpson), but it was objected that a\nchemically-heterogeneous nuclei population can produce a size-composition gradient\nthrough differential effects on condensation, which may not be obscured by\ncoagulation (St\u00e9ber). An optimal strategy should compare samples from both wings:\nof the size distribution as widely separated as is feasible in light of analytical\nconsiderations (St\u00e9ber).\n\nThis strategy requires knowledge of the mass distribution, but no method was\nadvanced for direct estination of the mass of size fractions. It was decided\n\nto obtain the mass distribution indirectly by calibrating the aerosol\n\nSpectrometen with cigarette smoke and making the assumption that the particles\n\nare unit density spheres (St\u00e9ber). A method for determining size distribution\ninvolving solidification of the particles with Eastman 910 vapor was described,\n\nbut the results showed! some disparity with those of the aerosol) spectrometer,\n\nand with published data from the sources (Carter). Because this technique shows\nSone promise for circumventing coagulation effects (by preventing coalescence of\naggregetes) it was decided to cancy out experiments to reconcile the discrepancies.\nA redetermination of size distribution by the Eastman 910 technique, using electro-\nstatic precipitation for sample deposition will be carried out (Carter).\n\nL6bz9STz02z",

The use of tobacco products by Army personnel poses a signifi-\ncant threat to the health and readiness of our force. It is well\ndocumented thet smoking is a leading cause of heart and lung\ndiseases, as well as many forms of cancer. Cigarette smoking in\nparticular is a significant threat to the development and mainten-\nGnce of a fit, fighting force. Although cigarette srching has been\nuniversally condemned by medical groups and Governnent media/offices\nfor the past 15 years, the majority (52 percent) of our active duty\nforce continue to smoke. The inmediate and pronounced consequence\nof smoking is the detrimental effect on combat readiness. Studies\nhave shown that smoking not only impairs exercise tole: but\nalso interferes with aerobic gains during training and impairs nist:\nvision, stamina, perceptual and motor skills such as zeaction tine,\nvisual acuity, and time perception. -\n\n2. Although the use of tobacco is a perplexing problem, there are\npositive actions that can be taken that will help reduce or elini-\nfate its use. In keeping with the Army themes of 191-a6...Spirit,\nFitness, Excellence, Family, Leadership, and Values...ic is\nbent upon leaders at all levels to demonstrate the\ncern for the well being of soldiers, civilian employe:\nand family members.\n\n3. \u2018The enclosed action plan represents the Department cf she Arny\nstrategy for tobacco cessation. This broad-based efor: -epresents\nthe commitment by numerous ageacies to reduce the health and readi~\nness risks associated with tobacco use.\n\n4.

From the enclosed\ncopies of the programs for last year and this, it is quite\nobvious that last year's conference was heavily weighted with\nanti-smoking papers. In fact, many entire sessions were\ndevoted to this subject alone.\n\nBy contrast this year's program contained no session\nor single paper which was devoted to the subject of smoking.\nThe entire program was oriented toward basic science in the\nunderstanding of abnormal pulmonary physiology. I would\nunhesitatingly say it was one of the most informative programs\nproduced in many years.\n\nI had an opportunity to spend some time with Dr.\nPetty and other members of the committee staff. They were\ncordial and most appreciative of the industry's contribution\nto the support of the Conference. It is difficult to escape\nthe conclusion that much of the animosity toward \"cigarette\nsmoking\" is directed toward the industry first \u201cgs its product,\nsecond. They were genuinely impressed by the fact that our\ncontribution was made with no attempt to censor the content of\nthe program.

Colby\n\nI called Dr. Crellin on May 21 to find out the best method for determining\nditerpenoid degradation products in tobacco. Dr. Crellin said that the\nbest method to use for this is the neutral volatile scan. He said that\nthis method was developed several years ago by Dr. Ian Brown at GREDC.\nWhile the procedure is time consuming (Soxhlet extraction with\ndichloromethane followed by acid and base washes and concentration of the\npurified extract), the resulting chromatogram only contains 20 to 25\nsignificant peaks and all of these have been well characterized.\n\nDr. Crellin said that this method was not used for Project SHIP because of\nthe time that it takes for each sample.\n\nWe also discussed the GR&DC Sandra scan procedure and the procedure for\nthe determination of labdanoids and cembranoids. Dr. Crellin said that\nthe Sandra scan procedure has been used predominately for preparing\nflavorful tobacco extracts for addback to tobacco rather than as an\nanalytical tool. He said that the resulting capillary GC chromatograms\nwere too complex to use unless the extract had first been fractionated by\nRPLC into about 20 subfractions. Current GR&DC work is with the Schultz\nversion of the Sandra apparatus and hexane is used as the organic solvent.\n\nDr. Crellin said that the method for labdanoids and cembranoids is useful\n\nwhen fast information about a sample of tobacco is needed, but would not\nProvide the information on the diterpenoid degradation products.\n\noP pee\nJ.

The term\n\"ambient exposure\" was to be used only in this context and as defined\n\nin the Introduction. Despite our exhortations, when the printed report\n\n* appeared, they have used the terms incorrectly in the title.\n\nThe significance of the study is that in their comprehensive search\nof the subject no clear and convincing direct evidence of a health effect\nto healthy non-smokers was found. \u2018The only two negative indications\nwere (1) the study reported by Aronow in the summer of 1978 in the\nNew England Journal of Medicine on angina patients, and (2) the epi-\ndemiological study by Colley and associates suggesting increased risk\n\nof bronchitis and pneumonia among infants (5 to 11 months only) of\nsmoking parents. :\n\nBeyond these indications the report is essentially neutral with the\nexception of some exaggerations, speculations, and extrapolations.\n\u2018These are greatly toned down from earlier drafts of the report. But\nthere are still enough \"maybe's,\" \"possibilities,\" and \"ifs\" in the final\nversion to suggest that the reviewers feel there must be some negative\nhealth effects even if there is no direct evidence of them. The reviewers\nobviously do not believe in threshold limits, but rather that high dose\neffects will also occur to some extent at the very low levels of exposure\nwith ambient cigarette smoke. To this extent they have biased the pre-\nsentation to make it of questionable value to us.\n\nThave additional copies if anyone wants them.\n\nAttachment\nHew\nec: C.H. Goldsmith A. Holtzman\nJ.C.

PARRACK JR.\n\nGPC TRADEMARK ENHANCEMENT\n\nDECEMBER 6, 1985\n\nTo summarize our 12/5 meeting with Herb Pease Sr. and John\nDiGianni.\n\nObjective\n\nTo develop an understanding of the steps required to improve\nconsumer attitudes towards and awareness of the GPC trademark\nas it appears on all products marketed by GPC.\n\nBackaround\n\nInitial study has shown that the GPC trademark has no\nconsistent presentation across their product lines, in their\nselling materials, correspondence, whatever. Each exposure of\nthe mark will make some impression, good or bad. Inconsistency\nmeans confusion.\n\nOur objective was to help GPC recognize the opportunity they're\nmissing. This is not an act of charity: any product that says\n\"GPC\" will have some ruboff on our cigarettes. Further, recent\nresearch suggests \"GPC\" doesn't have much, if any, consumer\nequity or even recognition. We're helping ourselves if we help\nthem: every package is an ad for GPC, whether it's a cigarette\npack or a can of corn.\n\n\u2018to put some teeth in this argument, we asked DiGianni to show\nhow package, logo design and corporate identity development\nwork. He reviewed examples from Citizens Fidelity Bank, Prince\nSauces, Lipton, Campbell, Brown-Forman and, of course, the\nCigarette category. The meeting ran from ten a.m. to three\np.m. The Peases were very enthusiastic.\n\nO74745708",

        "Ronald Carey was bom, and has lived in Queens, NY all his life. He is approximately\n57 years old. He is married to Barbara (his high school sweetheart) for more than 32\nyears and has 5 children. Upon graduation from high school he tumed down a\nswimming scholarship from St. John's University and enlisted in the Marine Corps.\nHe was discharged in 1955, and went to work at UPS where his Father had been\nemployed for 48 years. Ron was a reformer, was dissatisfied with the union's\nrelationship with UPS and was elected a Union Steward 4 years later. In 1968 he was\nlected President of IBT Local 804, a position he held until elected IBT International\nPresident in 1992. He is described as a workaholic, a reformist, liberal democrat,\n\u2018conservative in his personal likes and affairs, thrifty, and a union leader who is above\ncorruption. Shortly after his election, he cut his salary from $250,000 to $175,000\nand most recently cut his salary to $150,000. He was recently cleared of all Federal\nRICO charges that he was involved in \"mob\" related activities.\n\nRon Carey's intemal issues are almost all related to his fight with the union's \"old\nguard\". The Union is literally bankrupt. The Union's financial problems are a\ncombination of expenses incurred cleaning up the Teamsters (legal fee's, etc.), a\nconstitutional amenciment which increased the weekly strike benefit to $200 per week\nwithout any provision for finding. The lengthy support of the Diamond Walnut\nstrikers who have literally bankrupted the strike find. The recent Master Freight\n\u2018Strike caused the IBT to borrow several million dollars from the AFL-CIO to pay the\nstriking truck drivers.\n\nOther internal issues incude,\n\nse attempt to drive out all \u201cold guard Teamsters\" who have been fighting his\nefforts to clean up the Union.\n\n* reduction of Union Officer salaries by eliminating the past practice of multiple\nsalaries and pensions.\n\n* upsetting focal leadership by hiring(and paying large salaries) a staff\ncomprised almost exclusively radicals from the Mine Workers and SEIU.\n\nrevoking the charters of all four Conferences as a means of saving $14 million\nayear, The Conferences are staffed exclusively with anti-Carey \"old guard\u201d\n\u2018who claim the revocations are retaliation for their failure to support his recent\ndues increase proposal.\n\nsk Internal office clerical workers joining the OPEIU.

        "LEWIS C. SOLMON\n\nIntensive\u2019 study of personne] and productivity has led Lewis C. Solon, currently\ndean of the Graduate School of Education at UCLA, to conclude that workers who\nsmoke Go not lose more time to illness than their non-smoking counterparts,\n\ncontrary to published studies.\n\nHe cites a 1976 National Health Survey which showed that moderate smokers -~\nthose who smoke less than 15 cigarettes a day -- had an absenteeism rate of 2.6\n\ndays per year, compared to 4.3 days for workers who never smoked.\n\n\"Absenteeism is associated with numerous factors,\" says Solmon. \u201cA claimed\nassociation between smoking and absenteeism necessitates a demographic and\noccupational comparison between non-smokers and smokers. Because more\nblue-collar than white-collar workers smoke, any suggested correlation between\n\nsmoking and absenteeism, if it exists at all, might be due to hazardous or\n\nstrenuous jobs, job boredom, low pay, or other factors, ~~ not smoking.\"\nIn addition to his academic duties, Solmon is currently president of the Human\nResource Policy Corporation in Los Angeles. He has co-authored, authored or\n\nedited 17 books.\n\nAmong more than 50 research papers and articles bearing Solmon's name is \"The\nOther Side of the Smoking Worker Controversy,\" which appeared in Personnel\nAdministrator magazine in March 1983. He has been invited to lecture at Brown\nand Vanderbilt Universities and at the Anerican Psychological Association, among\n\nmany others.\n\n=~ more\n\nS8S6rsszoz",

Schwartz, Ph.D. is currently a professor in the department of\n\nPharmacology, Georgetown University Schools of Medicine and Dentistry.\n\nReceiving his bachelor of science degree in pharmacy medicine from the\nUniversity of Maryland at Baltimore and his doctorate in pharmacology from the\n\nMedical Colle:\n\nje of Virginia at Richmond, Schwartz then served in a variety of\nposts, including several with the U.S. Navy, where his work in the pharmacology\n\narea continued.\n\nIn addition to his teaching and publishing duties at Georgetown, he works in the\nCenter for Environmental Health and Human Toxicology to study varied effects the\n\n20th century environment has on human beings.\n\nAlong with his colleague Dr. Nancy J. Balter, Ph.D., Dr. Schwartz's most recent\n\nproject has centered on the effects of \"passive smoking\" on non-smokers.\n\nHaving analyzed all the current research in this area and compared it against\ntheir own work in the field of environmental health, Drs. Schwartz and Balter\nhave concluded there is nothing in the current research which would indicate\n\nthat ambient smoke causes a serious health hazard.",

        "\u2018+ Jobs Council: In 1997, the lieutenant governor led the most thorough and inclusive review of\nthe state's economic development programs to date. Tite Jobs Council process, which included\ninput from 75 men and women statewide, has resulted in changes that make Indiana's\neconomic development tools more efficient, more accountable, more targeted and more\ncustomer-service oriented than ever before,\n\n+ Agricultural Crisis Working Group: In 1998, Keman led the effort to pull together support for\nfarmers who struggled through some of darkest times in the agricultural industry's history.\n\u2018What first began as simply the Pork Crisis Working Group is now a bipartisan group of men\n\u2018and women who are on call to assist whenever necessary.\n\n| \u00abCommencement Speaker: Aiso that year, the lieutenant governor was honored by his alma\n\u2018mater when he was chosen as the commencement speaker for the University of Notre Dame's\n\u2018graduation ceremonies. He was awarded an honorary doctorate during the event.\n\n+ Reaching Out to Fellow Veterans: Lt. Governor Keman launched the Veterans Outreach\nInitiative in 1999 - an effort to encourage veterans to take advantage of the state and federal\nbenefits that they have eamed by serving their country. Thousands of veterans have received\ninformation from the lieutenant governor, outlining their benefits and how to go about\naccessing them.\n\n+ International Trade: Under Kernan's direction, the state has stepped up its international\npresence. In 1999, Indiana set a record for exporting: $14 billion worth of Hoosier goods were\nshipped outside the state. Four new overseas trade offices have opened during the lieutenant\n\u2018governors time in office, bringing the total to 12 worldwide.\n\n+ Business Attraction and Expansion: The Indiana Department of Commerce has helped bring 66\nnew companies, and assisted in the expansion of 687 existing companies with the lieutenant\n\u2018goveor at the helm. These projects have impacted more than 200,000 Hoosier jobs. Major\nsuccesses include expansions at Eli Lilly and Company in Indianapolis and Toyota Motor\n\u2018Manufacturing in Princeton, plus new development for AM General in St. Joseph County,\nSofumor Danek in Warsaw and Covance Inc. in Indianapolis.\n\n+ The 2ist Century Research and Technology Fund: Kernan is\nchairman of the fund, established in 1999, which supports\nnew business development in the high-tech, high-paying\nsectors of biomedical research and computer technology. In\nthe first round of funding, more than $15 million in grants\n\u2018were awarded to 13 companies, leveraging more than $40\nmillion in matching funds.\n\nand his wife, Maggie, were married in 1974.

It\ncatalyzes the reversible dehydration of lactyl CoA to acrylyi CoA. Atomic absorption and EPR:\n\u2018spectroscopy were used to characterize two Fe:S clusters on one of the proteins and that\nprobably interact with the substrates.\n\nFrom 1986-1988, | was a postdoctoral fellow with Dr. Stephen Benkovic at Pennsylvania\nState University. I was a recipient of an NRSA Postdoctoral Fellowship (GM1 1309) and\nstudied the mechanism of DNA polymerase | from E. coli (Klenow). Using a variety of steady-\nstate and pre-steady-state kinetic techniques in conjunction with isotope trapping\nexperiments, we elucidated a kinetic scheme that accurately describes the polymerization of\ncorrect nucleotides as well as the processes by which the enzyme obtains fidelity. The role of\nthe 3'-95' exonuclease was quantified using a mutant form of pol | that lacks exonuclease.\nMn+? was found to increase misincorporation by corrupting several of the processes that are\nimportant for insuring fidelity. Equations were developed that describe the relationships\nbetween catalytic efficiency, fidelity and the observed free energy profile.\n\nSince September, 1988 | have been an Assistant Professor in the Chemistry and\nBiochemistry Department at the University of Colorado. | am studying the mechanism of DNA\nprimase within the context of the primase:polymerase a complex using a variety of\nmechanistic probes.\n\nPublications:\n\nKuchta, R.

RELEVANT EXPERIENCE\n\n\u2018The Principal Investigator (P.1.) has had direct extensive experience with the methods of the presently\nProposed project. For two years of his postdoctoral training he carried out studies in basic cellular\nelectrophysiology at the University of Vi For the last 15 years the P.I. has carried out research, as\na principal investigator, on the mechanisms of electrophysiologic actions of ATP and adenosine in vivo. In\nthe past three years, he performed experiments involving direct recording of vagal afferent traffic. In\naddition, during this period, the P.. has collaborated with Dr. Drew Armour in studying the effects of purine\ncompounds on the activity of in situ intrinsic cardiac neurons in the canine heart. The P.!. authored and\ncoauthored numerous papers and reviews in the field of cardiac electrophysiology and pharmacology of\nadenosine and ATP, and has given many invited talks on his research work at national and international\nsymposia. In 1986, he organized the A.N. Richards Symposium, which was the first scientific meeting\ndevoted to the basic and clinical aspects of cardiac electrophysiology and pharmacology of adenosine and\nATP, and edited the proceedings book of this meeting. In addition, the P.|. organized and co-chaired a\nminisymposium on the cardiovascular pharmacology of adenosine and ATP which was held in May, 1989,\nas part of the XIll Congress of the International Society for Heart Research. Furthermore, the P.I. was a co-\nchairman of the 5th International Symposium on Adenosine and Adenine Nucleotides held in Philadelphi\nPA in May, 1994. Finally, the P. |. has been reviewing manuscripts dealing with studies in this and related\nfields for several leading scientific journals and research grant applications for the VA administration.\nC.

He interned in medicine\n\u2018at the New York Hospital! in New York City and was assistant resident in pathology at\nColunbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, also in New York City.\n\nAlthough his major professional interest 1s vascular disease, Dr. Naeye has made *\nseveral inportant contribution\u2019 to the field of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome research\nand, now, to the understanding of the effects of emoking on the pregnant onan and\nher developing fetus. Among hie 138 scientific publications, Dr. Naeye lists papers\ndealing with respiratory ailments of coal miners, matemal heroin addiction and the\neffects on the fetus, hyaline menb-ane disease, effects of maternal nutrition on the\nfetus, and amniotic fluid infections. This range of mbjects indicates the breadth\nof his professional interes\n\nDr. Naeye is currently on the editorial board of The Merican Journal of Pathology\nand serves as a consultant to the National Acadeniy of Sciences Committee on Epidemi\u2014\nology and Veteran's Follow-Up. He also belongs to numerous professional societies.\n\nwane\n\nDr. Naeye ie presenting two papers this week. The one dealing with maternal smoking\nwill be given Thursday, April 27, at 11:45 a.m., in the Grand Ballroom.\n\nIt has long been known that perinatal mortality rates increase with maternal cigarette\nsmoking during pregnancy, but the specific mechaniem vhich would account for these\ndeaths had not explained. In his paper Dr. Naeye describes some specific\n\ndisorders which adcount for these deaths.\n\nhad been recorded.\nrovide plausible explanations for most. of the\nexcess fetal and neonatal mortality sesociated with cigarette emoking.\n\nCigarette smoking was found to have a direct, independet association with increased\nfetal death due to several disorders. In the firet half of gestation, fetal death\ndue to abruptio placentae was 211 percent more frequent in smokers than in rionsmokers;\nafter midgestation, perinatal mortality due to abruptio placentae were 53 per-\ncent greater; Rh erythroblastosis fetalis, 81 percent greater; and congenital anomalic\n43 percent greater in offepring of smokers than of nonsmokers.\n\nInterestingly, the apparent teratogenic effects of cigarette smoking seem to increase\nPregnancy wastage but do mot have much effect on society; almost all of the shoking-\ninduced congenital anonalies are severe and lead to fetal or reonatal death, 60 that\nsurviving infants of snoking mothers have no greater a frequency of birth defects than\ndo infants of non-smoking mother:",

        "ALEARDO G. BUZZI\nPRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\nPHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL\n\nAleardo G. Buzzi was appointed President and Chief Executive\nOfficer of Philip Morris International Inc. in February,\n1990. In his new role, Mr. Buzzi is responsible for ali\nPhilip Morris\u2019 tobacco operations outside the United states,\nand the food and tobacco operations in Latin america.\n\nMr. Buzzi led the company\u2019s EEC Region cigarette business\nsince the creation of the Region in January 1982. In that\ntimey he managed PM EEC\u2019s growth to the position of the.\nnumber, one cigarette company and the rise of Marlboro to\nbest-selling cigarette brand in Europe. In April 1987, he\nWas named executive vice president of Philip Morris\nInternational.\n\nMr. Buzzi was born in Locarno, Switzerland, and studied at\nthe Bellinzona, Switzerland Business School. He began his\ncareer with Philip Morris in 1962 at what was to becone the\ncompany\u2019s Swiss affiliate, Fabriques de Tabac Riunies. In\n1966, he moved to the Philip Morris regional headquarters in\nLausanne as area director with responsibility for Italy and\nEastern Europe and was promoted to vice president in 1972.\nHe became a vice president of Philip Morris International in\n1974, and added other European markets to his area of\nresponsibility in the years that followed until his\nappointment as President of the EEC Region in 1982.\n\nThroughout his career Mr. Buzzi has combined a perceptive\nunderstanding of the European cigarette market with\nextensive personal involvement in other areas conducive to\nthe company\u2019s business and image.\n\nMr. Buzzi\u2019s role in the negotiation of licensing agreements\nbetween Philip Morris and the French, Italian and Austrian\ntobacco monopolies in the early 1960's were instrumental in\nestablishing a beachhead for the company in the European\nCommon Market. \u2018The agreements with Monital and Austria\nTabakwerke have since been renewed several times and have\nbeen joined by new agreements for license or contract\nmanufacturing in Belgium, Greece, and Malta.\n\nSe2ZE0E202",

He has done executive assessments for\nScores of companies, focussing on obtaining a rich-\ner and deeper understanding of the man than can be\nhad from just an interview plus paper-and-pencil\ntests. Such assessments pinpoint the directions in\nwhich the executive may enjoy most advancement, and\nwhat assipnments, training or formal education might\nfurther his development. Such predictions have been\nuseful in management training or collese recruiting\nprograms and in assessment of technicians, managers\nor missionaries before assignment overseas. Dr.\nMcArthur has gained some reputation as an expert on\nPersonnel in the financial community, even to being\nPopularized as a chapter in The Money Game!\n\nHe has for years been teaching seminars on the\ninterview in its various business applications, the\nstudents in these seminars being personnel directors\nand unit managers who have responsibilities for hir-\ning, promotion and assignment. He has also taught\nease method courses in management practices.\n\nHis academic position is at Harvard, where he\ndirects a longitudinal study of the lives and ca-\nreers of very able men, selected thirty years apo as\nlikely to make important contributions to society.\nAs a teacher, he has appeared for tuo decades in the\nPersonnel course at the Business School and been a\nsometime lecturer in the College, the Graduate School\nof Arts and Sciences and the Graduate School of Edu-\ncation. His present teaching assignments are in the\nGraduate School's Department of Social Relations and\nin the summer institutes sponsored by the Business\nSchool.\n\nHis appointment as Psychologist to the Univer-\nsity Health Service since 1950 has involved him in\nadministering a psychological service, in clinical\nwork with students and alumni, and, above all, in vo-\ncational guidance with very able men.

These studies have involved\ndetermining the effects on motor function of chemicals injected directly into\nspecific areas of the brain e.g. the nucleus accunbens, corpus striatum, globus\npallidus and substantia nigra. In addition, the effects of drugs have been\nexamined on neurotransmitter biochemistry, concentrating on the dopaminergic and\nGABAergic systems of the corpus striatum and nucleus accumbens. I have\npreviously studied the effects of amphetamine and methylphenidate on the\nsynthesis, release and turnover of dopamine both in vitro and in vivo.\n\nRecently, I have become interested in the interaction of dopaminergic system\nwith GABAergic neuronal system in the striatum and nucleus accumbens. I have\nfinished studying the acute and chronic effects of nicotine on dopaminergic and\nGABAergic systems in the striatum and the postnatal effects of maternal nicotine\nexposure.\n\nPublications (abstracted from a total of 45 publications)\n\n1) Fung, Y.
